The data will be produced by the ProdromeScan technology which is the most robust validated untargeted metabolomic assay available, providing accurate measurements of over 300 metabolites with <5% variance.

Here is the raw data report for the test sample.  There are 2 tabs.  Each tab has a male population distribution reference.  All data is expressed as a ratio to the QA serum that is run with each batch, so the number has no inherent meaning except that it is proportional.  We are still in the process of finalizing reporting, so a full data key is not yet available.  I will send it next week.  We will also be preparing more detailed reports next week as well. 

I do not have time to give a detailed analysis of the data but there are a few key points:

There appears to be overactive fatty acid synthase activity/elongation that is resulting in the decrease of saturated fatty acid containing lipids with a comparative sparing of essential fatty acid derived lipids such as linoleic acid (18:2 – 20:4).  This is similar to cancer growth.  However, unlike cancers which usually have a concomitant decrease in plasmalogens, plasmalogens are slightly increased and DHA (22:6) containing phospholipids are also increased relative to other fatty acids which suggests that the overactive FAS is driving the excessive peroxisomal activity – which makes DHA.  Ffrankly the data looks like the person is on a ppar-gamma or delta agonist.  Decreased triglycerides is also suggestive of ppar-gamma activation.  It is unlikely that the increased peroxisomal activity is due to mitochondrial dysfunction – it is more likely the other way around.  Excessive peroxisomal function is also associated with increased oxidative stress.  The elevated levels of GTAs is similar to what we see in relapsing-remitting MS.
