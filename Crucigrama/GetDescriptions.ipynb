            "HPSE2\t   The HPSE2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called heparanase 2. Little is known about this protein, but its structure is similar to that of another protein called heparanase 1. Heparanase 1 is an enzyme that splits (cleaves) molecules called heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) by removing the heparan sulfate portion (the side chain).HSPGs are important parts of the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix) and of basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Cleavage of HSPGs by heparanase 1 may lead to changes in the basement membrane or extracellular matrix that allow cell movement or release of substances from the cell. The specific function of the heparanase 2 enzyme is not well understood, but studies suggest that it may block the action of heparanase 1.

In mouse, a highly similar protein is thought to be responsible for maintaining the apical ectodermal ridge of developing limb buds; disruption of the mouse gene results in the absence of central digits, underdeveloped or absent metacarpal/metatarsal bones and syndactyly. This phenotype is remarkably similar to split hand-split foot malformation in humans, a clinically heterogeneous condition with a variety of modes of transmission.

This gene was originally isolated based on its deletion in a medulloblastoma cell line. This gene is expressed with transcripts of 6.0, 7.5, and 8.0 kb in fetal lung and with one transcript of 8.0 kb in adult lung, although the 7.5 kb transcript has not been characterized. The encoded protein precursor is a glycoprotein containing multiple scavenger receptor cysteine-rich (SRCR) domains separated by SRCR-interspersed domains (SID). Transcript variant 2 (8.0 kb) has been shown to bind surfactant protein D independently of carbohydrate recognition. This indicates that DMBT1 may not be a classical tumor suppressor gene, but rather play a role in the interaction of tumor cells and the immune system.

The protein also functions in the regulation of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. Mutations in this gene can cause Athabascan-type severe combined immunodeficiency (SCIDA) and Omenn syndrome. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]From UniProt:Required for V(D)J recombination, the process by which exons encoding the antigen-binding domains of immunoglobulins and T-cell receptor proteins are assembled from individual V, (D), and J gene segments. V(D)J recombination is initiated by the lymphoid specific RAG endonuclease complex, which generates site specific DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). These DSBs present two types of DNA end structures: hairpin sealed coding ends and phosphorylated blunt signal ends. These ends are independently repaired by the non homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway to form coding and signal joints respectively. This protein exhibits single-strand specific 5'-3' exonuclease activity in isolation and acquires endonucleolytic activity on 5' and 3' hairpins and overhangs when in a complex with PRKDC. The latter activity is required specifically for the resolution of closed hairpins prior to the formation of the coding joint. May also be required for the repair of complex DSBs induced by ionizing radiation, which require substantial end-processing prior to religation by NHEJ.

            "MBL2\t   The MBL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that assembles into a protein complex called mannose-binding lectin. Functional mannose-binding lectins are made up of two to six protein groups called trimers, which are each composed of three of the protein pieces (subunits) produced from the MBL2 gene. This protein complex plays an important role in the immune system's response to foreign invaders (pathogens).Mannose-binding lectin recognizes and attaches (binds) to sugars, such as mannose, fucose, and glucose, that are found on the surface of bacteria, viruses, and yeast. This binding turns on (activates) the complement system, which is a group of immune system proteins that work together to destroy pathogens, trigger inflammation, and remove debris from cells and tissues. Attachment of mannose-binding lectin also targets the pathogen to be engulfed and broken down by special immune cells. Recognition of foreign invaders by mannose-binding lectin provides one of the body's first lines of defense against infection.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Mannose-binding lectin deficiency     Several common mutations of the MBL2 gene can lead to a condition called mannose-binding lectin deficiency. People with this condition have low levels of mannose-binding lectin and may be susceptible to recurrent infections. Several of the disease-associated mutations occur in a region of the MBL2 gene known as exon 1 and result in a change to single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the mannose-binding lectin subunit. Other mutations occur in an area of DNA near the MBL2 gene called the promoter region, which helps control the production of the mannose-binding lectin subunit.The change of a single amino acid in the mannose-binding lectin subunit eliminates its ability to assemble into the functional mannose-binding lectin. Similarly, certain mutations in the promoter region of the MBL2 gene reduce production of the mannose-binding lectin subunit, leading to a decreased number of subunits available for protein assembly and a reduction in the amount of functional protein. With decreased levels of mannose-binding lectin, the body does not recognize and fight foreign invaders efficiently. Consequently, infections can be more common in people with this condition. However, researchers believe that a number of factors, including other genetic and environmental factors, are involved in the development of mannose-binding lectin deficiency.

            "ANK3\t   From NCBI Gene:Ankyrins are a family of proteins that are believed to link the integral membrane proteins to the underlying spectrin-actin cytoskeleton and play key roles in activities such as cell motility, activation, proliferation, contact, and the maintenance of specialized membrane domains. Multiple isoforms of ankyrin with different affinities for various target proteins are expressed in a tissue-specific, developmentally regulated manner. Most ankyrins are typically composed of three structural domains: an amino-terminal domain containing multiple ankyrin repeats; a central region with a highly conserved spectrin binding domain; and a carboxy-terminal regulatory domain which is the least conserved and subject to variation. Ankyrin 3 is an immunologically distinct gene product from ankyrins 1 and 2, and was originally found at the axonal initial segment and nodes of Ranvier of neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Feb 2011]From UniProt:In skeletal muscle, required for costamere localization of DMD and betaDAG1 (By similarity).

            "CDH23\t   The CDH23 gene provides instructions for making cadherin 23, a type of protein that helps cells stick together. Different versions of this protein are made in different cell types, including a short version in the retina, which is the light-sensitive layer in the back of the eye, and a longer version in the inner ear. Cadherin 23 interacts with other proteins in the cell membrane as part of a protein complex that is involved in cell attachment.Research suggests that the cadherin 23 protein complex helps to shape structures in the inner ear called hair bundles. These structures are made of stereocilia, which are hairlike projections that bend in response to sound waves. This bending motion is critical for converting sound waves to nerve impulses, which are then transmitted to the brain. Stereocilia are also elements of the vestibular system, the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. Bending of these stereocilia is needed to transmit signals from the vestibular system to the brain.In the retina, the role of the cadherin 23 protein complex is less well understood. Studies suggest that it plays a critical role in the function of photoreceptor cells, which are specialized cells that detect light and color.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Nonsyndromic hearing loss     Several dozen mutations in the CDH23 gene have been identified in people with nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene cause a form of hearing loss designated as DFNB12. This type of hearing loss begins before a child learns to speak (prelingual) and is severe to profound.Most of the mutations that cause DFNB12 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in cadherin 23. These mutations reduce but do not eliminate the function of this protein. The altered protein disrupts development of stereocilia in the inner ear, which leads to hearing loss.Researchers speculate that some children with apparently nonsyndromic hearing loss caused by a CDH23 mutation may actually have Usher syndrome (described below). A few children thought to have DFNB12 have developed the vision disorder retinitis pigmentosa later in life, which is characteristic of Usher syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Usher syndrome     More than 60 mutations in the CDH23 gene can cause Usher syndrome type I, which is characterized by a combination of hearing loss, vision loss, and problems with balance and coordination. Specifically, CDH23 gene mutations cause a form of the disorder known as Usher syndrome type ID (USH1D).Most of these mutations disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of cadherin 23 or preventing the production of any of this protein. Less frequently, mutations change single amino acids in cadherin 23. All of the CDH23 gene mutations that cause Usher syndrome appear to eliminate the function of cadherin 23. A lack of this protein in the inner ear disrupts the normal development and function of stereocilia, which leads to hearing loss and difficulty with balance and coordination.

            "PLAU\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a secreted serine protease that converts plasminogen to plasmin. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate A and B polypeptide chains. These chains associate via a single disulfide bond to form the catalytically inactive high molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (HMW-uPA). HMW-uPA can be further processed into the catalytically active low molecular weight urokinase-type plasminogen activator (LMW-uPA). This low molecular weight form does not bind to the urokinase-type plasminogen activator receptor. Mutations in this gene may be associated with Quebec platelet disorder and late-onset Alzheimer's disease. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.

            "KAT6B\t   The KAT6B gene provides instructions for making a type of enzyme called a histone acetyltransferase. These enzymes modify histones, which are structural proteins that attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a small molecule called an acetyl group to particular locations on histones, histone acetyltransferases control the activity of certain genes.Little is known about the function of the histone acetyltransferase produced from the KAT6B gene. It is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it interacts with many other proteins. It appears to regulate genes that are important for early development, including development of the skeleton and nervous system.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Genitopatellar syndrome     At least eight mutations in the KAT6B gene have been identified in people with genitopatellar syndrome, a rare condition characterized by genital abnormalities, missing or underdeveloped kneecaps (patellae), intellectual disability, and abnormalities affecting other parts of the body. The mutations that cause genitopatellar syndrome occur near the end of the KAT6B gene in a region known as exon 18. These mutations lead to the production of a shortened histone acetyltransferase enzyme. Researchers suspect that the shortened enzyme may function differently than the full-length version, altering the regulation of various genes during early development. Because the altered enzyme takes on a different function, these mutations are described as \"gain-of-function.\" However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of genitopatellar syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Ohdo syndrome, Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson variant     More than 10 mutations in the KAT6B gene have been found to cause the Say-Barber-Biesecker-Young-Simpson (SBBYS) variant of Ohdo syndrome. This condition has signs and symptoms that overlap with those of genitopatellar syndrome (described above), although some of the specific developmental abnormalities differ between the two conditions. Mutations that cause the SBBYS variant of Ohdo syndrome have been identified throughout the KAT6B gene, although  many of them occur in exon 18. Studies suggest that these mutations likely prevent the production of functional histone acetyltransferase from one copy of the KAT6B gene in each cell. A shortage of this enzyme impairs the regulation of various genes during early development. Because these mutations lead to a reduction in the enzyme, they are described as \"loss-of-function.\" However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the specific features of the condition. More About This Health Condition      Coloboma     Genetics Home Reference provides information about coloboma. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     Genetic changes involving the KAT6B gene have been associated with certain types of cancer. These mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. The genetic changes are chromosomal rearrangements (translocations) that disrupt the region of chromosome 10 containing the KAT6B gene. Researchers have found a translocation that attaches this region of chromosome 10 to part of chromosome 16 in some people with a cancer of blood-forming cells called acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This translocation has also been identified in some people with therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome, a blood disorder that can occur after a person has undergone chemotherapy for another form of cancer.It is unclear how translocations involving the KAT6B gene are related to the development of cancer. These changes likely alter histone modification, which could prevent normal regulation of gene activity. Impaired gene regulation may contribute to the growth of cancers by allowing abnormal cells to grow and divide uncontrollably.      Tumors     Somatic changes involving the KAT6B gene have also been identified in some people with uterine leiomyomas, which are noncancerous growths in the uterus that are also known as uterine fibroids. Uterine leiomyomas are common in adult women. These growths can cause pelvic pain and abnormal bleeding, and, in some cases, lead to an inability to have biological children (infertility). The genetic change associated with uterine leiomyomas is a translocation between the region of chromosome 10 containing the KAT6B gene and a particular region of chromosome 17. It is unclear how this translocation is related to tumor development. Changes in histone modification that impair normal gene regulation may allow certain cells to divide in an uncontrolled way, leading to the growth of a tumor.

            "KCNMA1\t   From NCBI Gene:MaxiK channels are large conductance, voltage and calcium-sensitive potassium channels which are fundamental to the control of smooth muscle tone and neuronal excitability. MaxiK channels can be formed by 2 subunits: the pore-forming alpha subunit, which is the product of this gene, and the modulatory beta subunit. Intracellular calcium regulates the physical association between the alpha and beta subunits. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Potassium channel activated by both membrane depolarization or increase in cytosolic Ca(2+) that mediates export of K(+). It is also activated by the concentration of cytosolic Mg(2+). Its activation dampens the excitatory events that elevate the cytosolic Ca(2+) concentration and/or depolarize the cell membrane. It therefore contributes to repolarization of the membrane potential. Plays a key role in controlling excitability in a number of systems, such as regulation of the contraction of smooth muscle, the tuning of hair cells in the cochlea, regulation of transmitter release, and innate immunity. In smooth muscles, its activation by high level of Ca(2+), caused by ryanodine receptors in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, regulates the membrane potential. In cochlea cells, its number and kinetic properties partly determine the characteristic frequency of each hair cell and thereby helps to establish a tonotopic map. Kinetics of KCNMA1 channels are determined by alternative splicing, phosphorylation status and its combination with modulating beta subunits. Highly sensitive to both iberiotoxin (IbTx) and charybdotoxin (CTX).

The channel is activated by diacylglycerol and is thought to be under the control of a phosphatidylinositol second messenger system. Activation of this channel occurs independently of protein kinase C and is not triggered by low levels of intracellular calcium. Defects in this gene are a cause of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis 2 (FSGS2). [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2009]From UniProt:Thought to form a receptor-activated non-selective calcium permeant cation channel (PubMed:19936226, PubMed:23291369). Probably is operated by a phosphatidylinositol second messenger system activated by receptor tyrosine kinases or G-protein coupled receptors. Activated by diacylglycerol (DAG) in a membrane-delimited fashion, independently of protein kinase C (PubMed:26892346). Seems not to be activated by intracellular calcium store depletion.

            "MRVI1\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene is similar to a putative mouse tumor suppressor gene (Mrvi1) that is frequently disrupted by mouse AIDS-related virus (MRV). The encoded protein, which is found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum, is similar to Jaw1, a lymphoid-restricted protein whose expression is down-regulated during lymphoid differentiation. This protein is a substrate of cGMP-dependent kinase-1 (PKG1) that can function as a regulator of IP3-induced calcium release. Studies in mouse suggest that MRV integration at Mrvi1 induces myeloid leukemia by altering the expression of a gene important for myeloid cell growth and/or differentiation, and thus this gene may function as a myeloid leukemia tumor suppressor gene. Several alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene, and alternative translation start sites, including a non-AUG (CUG) start site, are used. [provided by RefSeq, May 2011]From UniProt:Plays a role as NO/PRKG1-dependent regulator of IP3-induced calcium release; its phosphorylation by PRKG1 inhibits bradykinin and IP3-induced calcium release from intracellular stores. Recruits PRKG1 to the endoplasmic reticulum and may mediate the assembly of PRKG1 and ITPR1 in a macrocomplex. Involved in PRKG1 signaling cascade leading to inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation.

            "ATM\t   The ATM gene provides instructions for making a protein that is located primarily in the nucleus of cells, where it helps control the rate at which cells grow and divide. This protein also plays an important role in the normal development and activity of several body systems, including the nervous system and the immune system.  Additionally, the ATM protein assists cells in recognizing damaged or broken DNA strands. DNA can be damaged by agents such as toxic chemicals or radiation. Breaks in DNA strands also occur naturally when chromosomes exchange genetic material during cell division. The ATM protein coordinates DNA repair by activating enzymes that fix the broken strands. Efficient repair of damaged DNA strands helps maintain the stability of the cell's genetic information.Because of its central role in cell division and DNA repair, the ATM protein is of great interest in cancer research.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Ataxia-telangiectasia     Researchers have identified several hundred mutations in the ATM gene that cause ataxia-telangiectasia. People with this disorder have mutations in both copies of the ATM gene in each cell. Most of these mutations disrupt protein production, resulting in an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the ATM protein. Cells without any functional ATM protein are hypersensitive to radiation and do not respond normally to DNA damage. Instead of activating DNA repair, the defective ATM protein allows mutations to accumulate in other genes, which may cause cells to grow and divide in an uncontrolled way.  This kind of unregulated cell growth can lead to the formation of cancerous tumors.  In addition, ATM mutations can allow cells to die inappropriately, particularly affecting cells in a part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum). This loss of brain cells causes the movement problems characteristic of ataxia-telangiectasia.

            "TH\t   The TH gene provides instructions for making the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, which is important for normal functioning of the nervous system. Tyrosine hydroxylase takes part in the first step of the pathway that produces a group of hormones called catecholamines. This enzyme helps convert the protein building block (amino acid) tyrosine to a catecholamine called dopamine. Dopamine is also known as a neurotransmitter because it transmits signals between nerve cells in the brain to help control physical movement and emotional behavior. Other catecholamines called norepinephrine and epinephrine are produced from dopamine. Norepinephrine and epinephrine are involved in the autonomic nervous system, which controls involuntary body processes such as the regulation of blood pressure and body temperature.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Dopa-responsive dystonia     More than two dozen mutations in the TH gene have been found to cause dopa-responsive dystonia. This condition is characterized by a pattern of involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), tremors, and other uncontrolled movements and usually responds to treatment with a medication called L-Dopa. Most TH gene mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme, resulting in a decrease in functional enzyme. A reduction in normal tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme leads to a decrease in the production of dopamine, which causes the movement problems characteristic of dopa-responsive dystonia. The amount of functional enzyme that is produced is associated with the severity of the signs and symptoms. Less functional enzyme leads to more severe symptoms. More About This Health Condition      Tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency     More than 20 mutations in the TH gene have been identified in people with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) deficiency. These mutations result in reduced activity of the tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme. As a result, the body produces less dopamine, norepinephrine, and epinephrine. These catecholamines are necessary for normal nervous system function, and changes in their levels contribute to the abnormal movements, nervous system dysfunction, and other neurological problems seen in people with TH deficiency.Dopa-responsive dystonia is sometimes considered a mild form of tyrosine hydroxylase deficiency. It is uncertain whether they are two separate disorders or part of the same disease spectrum. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Certain common TH variations (polymorphisms) modify catecholamine production, which affects the risk of developing conditions associated with regulation of the autonomic nervous system. These TH gene polymorphisms affect the extent to which blood pressure increases with stress and may increase the risk of high blood pressure (hypertension).One TH gene polymorphism has been associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). SIDS is a major cause of death in babies younger than 1 year. It is characterized by sudden and unexplained death, usually during sleep. The polymorphism, called allele *9.3, is the most common TH gene polymorphism among people of European descent and has been identified in a larger percentage of babies who die from SIDS than in other babies. This version of the gene may affect the regulation of breathing or awakening in infants.

            "ANO5\t   The ANO5 gene provides instructions for making a protein called anoctamin-5. While the specific function of this protein is not well understood, it belongs to a family of proteins, called anoctamins, that act as chloride channels. Chloride channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions) in and out of cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Studies suggest that most anoctamin proteins function as chloride channels that are turned on (activated) in the presence of positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions); these channels are known as calcium-activated chloride channels. The mechanism for this calcium activation is unclear. Anoctamin proteins are also involved in maintaining the membrane that surrounds cells and repairing the membrane if it gets damaged.The anoctamin-5 protein is most abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. The regulation of chloride flow within muscle cells plays a role in controlling muscle contraction and relaxation.The anoctamin-5 protein is also found in other cells including heart (cardiac) muscle cells and bone cells. Studies have suggested that the anoctamin-5 protein may be important for the development of muscle and bone before birth.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia     At least three ANO5 gene mutations have been identified in people with a bone disorder called gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, which leads to fragile bones, jaw problems, and other skeletal abnormalities. The ANO5 gene mutations that cause gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the anoctamin-5 protein. It is unclear how these mutations lead to the signs and symptoms of gnathodiaphyseal dysplasia, or why they primarily affect bones while other ANO5 gene mutations cause muscle disorders. Researchers suggest that the mutations may affect the way cells process calcium, an important mineral in bone development and growth. More About This Health Condition      Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy     More than 40 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L. Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy), particularly in the shoulders, hips, thighs, and upper arms.The ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2L change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein sequence, disrupt how genetic information is pieced together to make a blueprint for producing the protein, or result in a premature stop signal that leads to an abnormally short protein. One of the mutations adds an extra DNA building block (nucleotide) to the ANO5 gene (written as 191dupA) and is believed to be a relatively common cause of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy in people with northern European ancestry. This mutation alters the instructions used to make the anoctamin-5 protein, leading to a premature stop signal that would produce an abnormally short protein. Instead, a cellular error-catching mechanism called nonsense-mediated decay prevents the protein from being produced at all.ANO5 gene mutations that eliminate or impair the role of the anoctamin-5 protein as a chloride channel likely lead to impaired muscle function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. More About This Health Condition      Miyoshi myopathy     At least 10 mutations in the ANO5 gene have been found to cause Miyoshi myopathy. When caused by mutations in this gene, the condition is also known as distal anoctaminopathy. Miyoshi myopathy is a muscle disorder that is characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy of muscles that are away from the center of the body (distal muscles), particularly those in the legs. The ANO5 gene mutations identified in people with Miyoshi myopathy change single amino acids in the anoctamin-5 protein or result in the production of an abnormally short protein that is quickly broken down.These mutations result in the production of little or no anoctamin-5 protein. The effects of the loss of anoctamin-5 are unclear. While chloride is necessary for normal muscle function, it is unknown how a lack of this chloride channel causes the signs and symptoms of Miyoshi myopathy.The 191dupA mutation that can cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (described above) is also a common cause of Miyoshi myopathy in individuals of northern European ancestry. It is not known why the 191dupA mutation can result in different patterns of signs and symptoms. Miyoshi myopathy caused by ANO5 gene mutations is likely a variation of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy because it is caused by mutations in the same gene, and in some cases even by the same mutation.

            "CDKN1C\t   The CDKN1C gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps regulate growth. This protein acts as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too fast or in an uncontrolled way. It also is involved in controlling growth before birth, preventing the developing fetus from becoming too large.People inherit one copy of most genes from their mother and one copy from their father. Both copies are typically active, or \"turned on,\" in cells. However, the activity of the CDKN1C gene depends on which parent it was inherited from. In most tissues, the copy of the gene inherited from a person's mother (the maternally inherited copy) has much higher activity than the copy inherited from the father (the paternally inherited copy). This sort of parent-specific difference in gene activation is caused by a phenomenon called genomic imprinting.CDKN1C is part of a cluster of genes on the short (p) arm of chromosome 11 that undergo genomic imprinting. A nearby region of DNA known as imprinting center 2 (IC2) or KvDMR controls the parent-specific genomic imprinting of CDKN1C and several other genes thought to help regulate growth. The IC2 region undergoes a process called methylation, which is a chemical reaction that attaches small molecules called methyl groups to certain segments of DNA. Methylation, which occurs during the formation of an egg or sperm cell, is a way of marking or \"stamping\" the parent of origin. The IC2 region is normally methylated only on the maternally inherited copy of chromosome 11.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome     Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome is a condition that causes overgrowth and has other signs and symptoms that affect many parts of the body. At least half of all cases of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome result from changes in methylation of the IC2 region. Specifically, the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region has too few methyl groups attached (hypomethylation). This abnormality disrupts the regulation of several genes that are normally controlled by IC2, including CDKN1C. Because this gene normally restrains cell growth and division, a reduction in its activity leads to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome.In a few cases, Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome has been caused by deletions of a small amount of DNA from the maternally inherited copy of the IC2 region. Like abnormal methylation, these deletions disrupt the activity of several genes, including CDKN1C.Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome can also result from mutations within the maternally inherited copy of the CDKN1C gene. More than two dozen such mutations have been identified. Some of these genetic changes lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the CDKN1C protein, while others alter single protein building blocks (amino acids) or delete a small number of amino acids from the protein. All of these mutations are described as \"loss-of-function\" because they alter the structure of the CDKN1C protein such that it can no longer control growth effectively. The resulting problems with growth regulation lead to overgrowth and the other features of Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and genital anomalies     Intrauterine growth restriction, metaphyseal dysplasia, adrenal hypoplasia congenita, and genital anomalies, commonly known by the acronym IMAGe, is a rare syndrome that affects the growth of many parts of the body. The condition is characterized by slow growth before and after birth, skeletal abnormalities, hormonal changes, and genital abnormalities in males. At least six mutations in the CDKN1C gene have been found to cause this condition. Because this gene is paternally imprinted, IMAGe syndrome results only when the mutation is present on the maternally inherited copy of the gene.The CDKN1C gene mutations that cause IMAGe syndrome replace single amino acids in a region known as the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-binding domain near the end of the gene. These mutations appear to increase the stability of the CDKN1C protein, preventing it from being broken down normally. These changes increase the amount of the protein that is available to restrain cell growth and division. Because these mutations enhance the protein's usual function, they are described as \"gain-of-function.\" The excess CDKN1C protein leads to IMAGe syndrome by impairing normal growth and development starting before birth.

            "PDHX\t   The PDHX gene provides instructions for making a protein called E3 binding protein, which is part of a large group of proteins known as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. This complex is made up of several enzymes, including one called E3, and other proteins. E3 binding protein attaches E3 to the complex and provides the correct structure for the complex to perform its function.The pyruvate dehydrogenase complex plays an important role in the pathways that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. This enzyme converts a molecule called pyruvate, which is formed from the breakdown of carbohydrates, into another molecule called acetyl-CoA. This conversion is essential to begin the series of chemical reactions that produces adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the cell's main energy source.

This condition is characterized by a potentially life-threatening buildup of a chemical called lactic acid in the body (lactic acidosis), delayed development, and neurological problems. PDHX gene mutations associated with pyruvate dehydrogenase deficiency result in the complete absence of E3 binding protein. Loss of this protein impairs the binding of the E3 enzyme to the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which leads to a reduction of the complex's activity. With decreased function of this complex, pyruvate builds up and is converted, in another chemical reaction, to lactic acid, causing lactic acidosis.

            "RAPSN\t   The RAPSN gene provides instructions for making a protein called rapsyn that attaches (binds) to the different parts (subunits) of a protein found in the muscle cell membrane called acetylcholine receptor (AChR). This binding helps keep the receptor subunits together and anchors the AChR protein in the muscle cell membrane. The AChR protein plays a critical role in the normal function of the neuromuscular junction. The neuromuscular junction is the area between the ends of nerve cells and muscle cells where signals are relayed to trigger muscle movement.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Congenital myasthenic syndrome     At least 45 mutations in the RAPSN gene have been found to cause congenital myasthenic syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the rapsyn protein. A common mutation replaces the amino acid asparagine with the amino acid lysine at position 88 in the rapsyn protein (written as Asn88Lys or N88K). Most mutations in the RAPSN gene result in a reduction in functional rapsyn protein. The lack of rapsyn protein results in decreased binding between rapsyn and the AChR protein, which leads to disorganization of the receptor protein in the muscle cell membrane and a reduction in the number of receptors. As a result, signaling at the neuromuscular junction is decreased, which leads to decreased muscle movement and the muscle weakness characteristic of congenital myasthenic syndrome.

This enzyme is found in lysosomes, which are small compartments in the cell that digest and recycle molecules. Acid sphingomyelinase is responsible for the conversion of a fat (lipid) called sphingomyelin into another type of lipid called ceramide. Sphingomyelin also binds (attaches) to a fat called cholesterol and helps to form other lipids that play roles in various cell processes. The formations of these lipids is critical for the normal structure and function of cells and tissues.

These types of Niemann-Pick disease are characterized by a buildup of fat within cells that leads to lung disease and enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly). Type A is more severe and is characterized by severe neurological impairment in early childhood.SMPD1 gene mutations that cause complete loss of enzyme function tend to cause Niemann-Pick disease type A. In the Ashkenazi (eastern and central European) Jewish population, three mutations are responsible for about 90 percent of all Niemann-Pick disease type A cases. Mutations that lead to the production of an enzyme that retains some activity often cause Niemann-Pick disease type B. A reduction in enzyme activity within cells allows sphingomyelin to accumulate in cells. The accumulation of this lipid causes cells to malfunction and eventually die.

            "MYO7A\t   The MYO7A gene provides instructions for making a protein called myosin VIIA, which is part of a group of proteins called unconventional myosins. These proteins, which have similar structures, help transport molecules within cells. Myosins interact with actin, a protein that is important for cell movement and shape. Researchers believe that myosins use long filaments of actin as tracks along which to transport other molecules.Myosin VIIA is made in the inner ear and in the retina, which is the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. In the inner ear, myosin VIIA plays a role in the development and maintenance of hairlike projections called stereocilia. Stereocilia, which are rich in actin, line the inner ear and bend in response to sound waves. This bending motion is critical for converting sound waves to nerve impulses, which are then transmitted to the brain. Stereocilia are also elements of the vestibular system, the part of the inner ear that helps maintain the body's balance and orientation in space. Bending of these stereocilia is needed to transmit signals from the vestibular system to the brain.In the retina, myosin VIIA is found primarily in a thin layer of cells called the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Myosin VIIA probably plays a role in the development and maintenance of this tissue, which supports and nourishes the retina. Research suggests that one function of myosin VIIA is to carry small sacs of pigment (called melanosomes) within the RPE. This pigment is necessary for normal vision. Myosin VIIA is also found in other parts of the retina, where it likely carries additional proteins and molecules that are important for vision.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Nonsyndromic hearing loss     Researchers have identified several MYO7A gene mutations that can cause nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene are thought to cause two forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss: DFNA11 and DFNB2.DFNA11 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one mutated copy of the MYO7A gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. This form of hearing loss begins in childhood, after a child learns to speak (postlingual), and becomes more severe over time.Most of the mutations that cause DFNA11 alter a single protein building block (amino acid) in myosin VIIA, resulting in an abnormal protein that does not work properly. Other genetic changes delete a small amount of DNA from critical regions of the MYO7A gene, which probably changes the structure of the protein. Researchers suspect that the altered protein causes hearing loss by disrupting the growth and organization of stereocilia in the inner ear.DFNB2 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the MYO7A gene are mutated in each cell. The hearing loss can be postlingual or begin before a child learns to speak (prelingual). Some researchers have suggested that individuals with DFNB2 may actually have Usher syndrome (described below), because some individuals who were thought to have nonsyndromic hearing loss developed retinitis pigmentosa (a vision disorder characteristic of Usher syndrome) later in life. However, other individuals diagnosed with DFNB2 never develop retinitis pigmentosa, and recent studies indicate that DFNB2 and Usher syndrome probably result from different mutations in the MYO7A gene.The mutations that cause DFNB2 alter the structure and function of myosin VIIA, but they probably do not eliminate the protein's function completely. Recent studies found that the protein likely retains enough function in the retina to allow for normal vision, but not enough function in the inner ear to permit normal hearing. More About This Health Condition      Usher syndrome     More than 200 mutations in the MYO7A gene have been identified in people with Usher syndrome type I, which is characterized by a combination of hearing loss, vision loss, and problems with balance and coordination. Specifically, MYO7A gene mutations cause a form of the disorder known as Usher syndrome type IB (USH1B), which accounts for more than half of all cases of Usher syndrome type I.Many of these genetic changes alter a single protein building block (amino acid) in critical regions of the myosin VIIA protein. Other mutations introduce a premature stop signal in the instructions for making myosin VIIA. Still other mutations insert or delete small amounts of DNA in the MYO7A gene. All of these changes lead to the production of a nonfunctional version of myosin VIIA or prevent the production of any of this protein. A lack of myosin VIIA in the inner ear disrupts the normal development and function of stereocilia, which leads to hearing loss and difficulty with balance and coordination. A lack of myosin VIIA in the retina causes retinitis pigmentosa, a condition in which light-sensing cells of the retina gradually deteriorate, resulting in progressive vision loss.

            "TYR\t   The TYR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tyrosinase.  This enzyme is located in melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Tyrosinase is responsible for the first step in melanin production.  It converts a protein building block (amino acid) called tyrosine to another compound called dopaquinone.  A series of additional chemical reactions convert dopaquinone to melanin in the skin, hair follicles, the colored part of the eye (the iris), and the retina.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Oculocutaneous albinism     More than 100 mutations in the TYR gene have been identified in people with oculocutaneous albinism type 1.  These mutations disrupt the normal production of melanin, which reduces coloring of the hair, skin, and eyes and causes problems with vision. Most TYR mutations eliminate the activity of tyrosinase, preventing melanocytes from producing any melanin throughout life.  These mutations cause a form of oculocutaneous albinism called type 1A (OCA1A).  People with this form of albinism have white hair, light-colored eyes, and very pale skin that does not tan. Other mutations in the TYR gene reduce but do not eliminate tyrosinase activity.  These mutations, which allow some melanin to be produced, cause oculocutaneous albinism type 1B (OCA1B).  People with type 1B are also born with white hair, light-colored eyes, and pale skin, but hair and eye color often darken over time and skin may tan.

By itself, the protein has 3' to 5' exonuclease activity and endonuclease activity. The protein forms a complex with the RAD50 homolog; this complex is required for nonhomologous joining of DNA ends and possesses increased single-stranded DNA endonuclease and 3' to 5' exonuclease activities. In conjunction with a DNA ligase, this protein promotes the joining of noncomplementary ends in vitro using short homologies near the ends of the DNA fragments. This gene has a pseudogene on chromosome 3. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

All family members are proline and glutamine-rich, and contain a conserved basic domain that binds the ankyrin repeat domain of the intracellular domain of the Notch receptors (ICN1-4) in their N-terminus, and a transcriptional activation domain in their C-terminus. This protein binds to an extended groove that is formed by the interaction of CBF1, Suppressor of Hairless, LAG-1 (CSL) with ICN, and positively regulates Notch signaling. High levels of expression of this gene have been observed in several B cell-derived lymphomas. Translocations resulting in fusion proteins with both CRTC1 and CRTC3 have been implicated in the development of mucoepidermoid carcinomas, while a translocation event with CXCR4 has been linked with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

This protein functions as a receptor for bile acids, and when bound to bile acids, binds to DNA and regulates the expression of genes involved in bile acid synthesis and transport. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]From UniProt:Isoform 1: Promotes transcriptional activation of target genes NR0B2/SHP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA), SLC51B/OSTB (inducible by unconjugated CDCA and DCA) and FABP6/IBAP; low activity for ABCB11/BSEP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA, DCA and ACA); not inducible by taurine- and glycine-amidated CDCA.Isoform 4: Promotes transcriptional activation of target genes ABCB11/BSEP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA, ACA and DCA), NR0B2/SHP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA, ACA and DCA), SLC51B/OSTB (inducible by unconjugated CDCA and DCA) and FABP6/IBAP; most efficient isoform compared to isoforms 1 to 3; not inducible by taurine- and glycine-amidated CDCA.Ligand-activated transcription factor. Receptor for bile acids (BAs) such as chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), lithocholic acid, deoxycholic acid (DCA) and allocholic acid (ACA). Plays a essential role in BA homeostasis through the regulation of genes involved in BA synthesis, conjugation and enterohepatic circulation. Also regulates lipid and glucose homeostasis and is involved innate immune response (PubMed:10334992, PubMed:10334993, PubMed:21383957, PubMed:22820415). The FXR-RXR heterodimer binds predominantly to farnesoid X receptor response elements (FXREs) containing two inverted repeats of the consensus sequence 5'-AGGTCA-3' in which the monomers are spaced by 1 nucleotide (IR-1) but also to tandem repeat DR1 sites with lower affinity, and can be activated by either FXR or RXR-specific ligands. It is proposed that monomeric nuclear receptors such as NR5A2/LRH-1 bound to coregulatory nuclear responsive element (NRE) halfsites located in close proximity to FXREs modulate transcriptional activity (By similarity). In the liver activates transcription of the corepressor NR0B2 thereby indirectly inhibiting CYP7A1 and CYP8B1 (involved in BA synthesis) implicating at least in part histone demethylase KDM1A resulting in epigenomic repression, and SLC10A1/NTCP (involved in hepatic uptake of conjugated BAs). Activates transcription of the repressor MAFG (involved in regulation of BA synthesis) (By similarity). Activates transcription of SLC27A5/BACS and BAAT (involved in BA conjugation), ABCB11/BSEP (involved in bile salt export) by directly recruiting histone methyltransferase CARM1, and ABCC2/MRP2 (involved in secretion of conjugated BAs) and ABCB4 (involved in secretion of phosphatidylcholine in the small intestine) (PubMed:12754200, PubMed:15471871, PubMed:17895379).

In the intestine activates FGF19 expression and secretion leading to hepatic CYP7A1 repression (PubMed:12815072, PubMed:19085950). The function also involves the coordinated induction of hepatic KLB/beta-klotho expression (By similarity). Regulates transcription of liver UGT2B4 and SULT2A1 involved in BA detoxification; binding to the UGT2B4 promoter seems to imply a monomeric transactivation independent of RXRA (PubMed:12806625, PubMed:16946559). Modulates lipid homeostasis by activating liver NR0B2/SHP-mediated repression of SREBF1 (involved in de novo lipogenesis), expression of PLTP (involved in HDL formation), SCARB1 (involved in HDL hepatic uptake), APOE, APOC1, APOC4, PPARA (involved in beta-oxidation of fatty acids), VLDLR and SDC1 (involved in the hepatic uptake of LDL and IDL remnants), and inhibiting expression of MTTP (involved in VLDL assembly (PubMed:12660231, PubMed:12554753, PubMed:15337761). Increases expression of APOC2 (promoting lipoprotein lipase activity implicated in triglyceride clearance) (PubMed:11579204). Transrepresses APOA1 involving a monomeric competition with NR2A1 for binding to a DR1 element (PubMed:11927623, PubMed:21804189). Also reduces triglyceride clearance by inhibiting expression of ANGPTL3 and APOC3 (both involved in inhibition of lipoprotein lipase) (PubMed:12891557). Involved in glucose homeostasis by modulating hepatic gluconeogenesis through activation of NR0B2/SHP-mediated repression of respective genes. Modulates glycogen synthesis (inducing phosphorylation of glycogen synthase kinase-3) (By similarity). Modulates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion and is involved in insulin resistance (PubMed:20447400). Involved in intestinal innate immunity. Plays a role in protecting the distal small intestine against bacterial overgrowth and preservation of the epithelial barrier (By similarity). Down-regulates inflammatory cytokine expression in several types of immune cells including macrophages and mononuclear cells (PubMed:21242261). Mediates trans-repression of TLR4-induced cytokine expression; the function seems to require its sumoylation and prevents N-CoR nuclear receptor corepressor clearance from target genes such as IL1B and NOS2 (PubMed:19864602). Involved in the TLR9-mediated protective mechanism in intestinal inflammation. Plays an anti-inflammatory role in liver inflammation; proposed to inhibit proinflammatory (but not antiapoptotic) NF-kappa-B signaling) (By similarity).Isoform 2: Promotes transcriptional activation of target genes ABCB11/BSEP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA, DCA and ACA), NR0B2/SHP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA DCA and ACA), SLC51B/OSTB (inducible by unconjugated CDCA and DCA) and FABP6/IBAP; not inducible by taurine- and glycine-amidated CDCA.Isoform 3: Promotes transcriptional activation of target genes NR0B2/SHP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA), SLC51B/OSTB (inducible by unconjugated CDCA and DCA) and IBAP; low activity for ABCB11/BSEP (inducible by unconjugated CDCA, DCA and ACA); not inducible by taurine- and glycine-amidated CDCA.

As its name suggests, this enzyme is involved in the formation of clusters of iron and sulfur atoms (Fe-S clusters). Specifically, the enzyme acts as a platform, or scaffold, for the assembly of these clusters. Fe-S clusters are critical for the function of many different proteins, including those needed for DNA repair and the regulation of iron levels. Proteins containing Fe-S clusters are also necessary for energy production within mitochondria, which are the cell structures that convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use.

The more common mutation, written as IVS5+382G>C, alters the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to produce the enzyme. Most affected individuals have this mutation in both copies of the ISCU gene in each cell. The other mutation, which has been identified in one family, replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid glutamate at position 50 in the enzyme (written as Gly50Glu or G50E). Affected individuals in this family have had the G50E mutation in one copy of the ISCU gene in each cell and the IVS5+382G>C mutation in the other copy of the gene. This combination of mutations causes a severe variant of the disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting.Mutations in the ISCU gene severely limit the amount of iron-sulfur cluster assembly enzyme that is made in cells.

            "ATXN2\t   The ATXN2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-2. This protein is found throughout the body, but its function is unknown. Ataxin-2 is found in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm) and seems to interact with a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum. The endoplasmic reticulum is involved in protein production, processing, and transport. Researchers believe that ataxin-2 may be involved in processing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA. Ataxin-2 is also thought to play a role in the translation of genetic information to produce proteins.One region of the ATXN2 gene contains a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated approximately 22 times within the gene.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2     Spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA2 results from a mutation in the ATXN2 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN2 gene. People with 32 or more repeats CAG repeats in the ATXN2 gene develop SCA2.It is unclear how the abnormally long CAG segment affects the function of the ataxin-2 protein. The abnormal protein apparently leads to cell death, as people with SCA2 show a loss of brain cells. Certain brain cells called Purkinje cells seem to be particularly sensitive to the presence of abnormal ataxin-2. Purkinje cells are located in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum) and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). It is unknown how the abnormal ataxin-2 protein leads to the death of Purkinje and other brain cells. Over time, the loss of these cells causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA2.

            "OAS1\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene is induced by interferons and encodes a protein that synthesizes 2',5'-oligoadenylates (2-5As). This protein activates latent RNase L, which results in viral RNA degradation and the inhibition of viral replication. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants with different enzymatic activities. Polymorphisms in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to viral infection and diabetes mellitus, type 1. A disease-associated allele in a splice acceptor site influences the production of the p46 splice isoform. This gene is located in a cluster of related genes on chromosome 12. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2016]From UniProt:Interferon-induced, dsRNA-activated antiviral enzyme which plays a critical role in cellular innate antiviral response. In addition, it may also play a role in other cellular processes such as apoptosis, cell growth, differentiation and gene regulation. Synthesizes higher oligomers of 2'-5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP which then bind to the inactive monomeric form of ribonuclease L (RNase L) leading to its dimerization and subsequent activation. Activation of RNase L leads to degradation of cellular as well as viral RNA, resulting in the inhibition of protein synthesis, thus terminating viral replication. Can mediate the antiviral effect via the classical RNase L-dependent pathway or an alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L. The secreted form displays antiviral effect against vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) and stimulates the alternative antiviral pathway independent of RNase L.

            "ACADS\t   The ACADS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD). This enzyme functions within mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. SCAD is essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.SCAD is required to metabolize a group of fats called short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids are found in some foods and are also produced when larger fatty acids are metabolized. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods without food (fasting), fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency     More than 55 mutations in the ACADS gene have been found to cause short-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase (SCAD) deficiency. Almost all of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SCAD enzyme. These mutations prevent the enzyme from properly metabolizing short-chain fatty acids. As a result, these fats are not converted into energy, which can lead to the characteristic signs and symptoms of this disorder, including lack of energy (lethargy), low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), poor muscle tone (hypotonia), and weakness.Researchers have also identified two common variations (polymorphisms) in the ACADS gene that each change one amino acid in the SCAD enzyme. Unlike other changes in the ACADS gene, these polymorphisms do not cause SCAD deficiency but may increase a person's risk of developing this disorder. One of these polymorphisms replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 147 (written as Arg147Trp or R147W). The other polymorphism switches the amino acid glycine with the amino acid serine at protein position 185 (written as Gly185Ser or G185S). Other genetic and environmental factors likely influence the risk of developing SCAD deficiency when a person carries either of these polymorphisms.

            "ATP6V0A2\t   The ATP6V0A2 gene provides instructions for making one part, the a2 subunit, of a large protein complex (a group of proteins that work together). This protein complex is known as a vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). A V-ATPase acts as a pump to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across cell membranes.V-ATPases are embedded in the membranes surrounding cells, where they transport protons into and out of cells. This movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.Within cells, V-ATPases help regulate the pH of particular cell compartments. These compartments include endosomes and lysosomes, which digest and recycle materials that the cell no longer needs. Studies suggest that V-ATPases are also involved in the movement (trafficking) of small sac-like structures called vesicles. Vesicles transport many types of molecules within cells.V-ATPases also play a key role in a complex process called glycosylation, in which proteins are modified by adding sugar molecules. Glycosylation is necessary for the normal function of many different kinds of proteins. V-ATPases regulate the pH of a cellular structure called the Golgi apparatus, where glycosylation occurs.

ATP6V0A2 mutations cause a form of the disorder called autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II, which is characterized by loose, sagging skin and distinctive facial features. Some affected individuals also have delayed development, intellectual disability, seizures, and problems with movement that can worsen over time.Mutations in the ATP6V0A2 gene prevent the cell from producing a functional a2 subunit, which disrupts the normal function of V-ATPases. It is unclear how these genetic changes cause the signs and symptoms of cutis laxa. Researchers suspect that changes in V-ATPase function may disrupt the normal glycosylation of proteins, including several that are involved in the assembly and maintenance of elastic fibers. Elastic fibers are slender bundles of proteins that provide strength and flexibility to connective tissue (tissue that supports the body's joints and organs). People with cutis laxa have a reduced density of elastic fibers, which weakens connective tissue in the skin, lungs, and other organs.

            "DDX11\t   The DDX11 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ChlR1, which functions as a helicase. Helicases are enzymes that attach (bind) to DNA and temporarily unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the DNA molecule so it can be copied (replicated) in preparation for cell division. ChlR1 is also involved in repairing any errors that are made when DNA is copied. In addition, ChlR1 is involved in other processes leading up to cell division. After replication, the DNA from each chromosome is arranged into two identical structures, called sister chromatids, which the ChlR1 enzyme helps to keep together until they are ready to separate into individual cells. This enzyme also ensures proper separation of chromatids during cell division. By helping repair errors in DNA and ensuring proper DNA replication, the ChlR1 enzyme plays a role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.

This condition causes multiple abnormalities that may include impaired growth, distinctive facial features, hearing loss, and heart malformations. The mutations that cause Warsaw breakage syndrome severely reduce or completely eliminate ChlR1 enzyme activity. As a result, the enzyme cannot bind to DNA and cannot unwind the DNA strands to help with DNA replication and repair. A lack of functional ChlR1 impairs cell division and leads to an accumulation of DNA damage. This DNA damage can appear as breaks in the DNA, giving the condition its name.

            "VDR\t   The VDR gene provides instructions for making a protein called vitamin D receptor (VDR), which allows the body to respond to vitamin D. This vitamin can be acquired from foods in the diet or made in the body with help from sunlight exposure. Vitamin D is involved in maintaining the proper balance of several minerals in the body, including calcium and phosphate, which are essential for the normal formation of bones and teeth. One of vitamin D's major roles is to control the absorption of calcium and phosphate from the intestines into the bloodstream. Vitamin D is also involved in several processes unrelated to bone and tooth formation.The VDR protein attaches (binds) to the active form of vitamin D, known as calcitriol. This interaction allows VDR to partner with another protein called retinoid X receptor (RXR). The resulting complex then binds to particular regions of DNA, known as vitamin D response elements, and regulates the activity of vitamin D-responsive genes. By turning these genes on or off, the complex helps control calcium and phosphate absorption and other processes.Although the mechanism is not completely understood, the VDR protein is also involved in hair growth. Studies suggest that this process does not require calcitriol binding.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Vitamin D-dependent rickets     Mutations in the VDR gene cause vitamin D-dependent rickets type 2A (VDDR2A), also known as hereditary vitamin D-resistant rickets (HVDRR). This disorder of bone development is characterized by low levels of calcium (hypocalcemia) and phosphate (hypophosphatemia) in the blood, which lead to soft, weak bones (rickets) that are prone to fracture. A common feature of this condition is abnormally curved (bowed) legs.The VDR gene mutations that cause this condition prevent the VDR protein from functioning properly. Some changes in the VDR gene lead to an abnormally short version of the VDR protein. Others result in the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to calcitriol, to RXR, or to DNA. Although there is plenty of calcitriol in the body, the altered VDR protein cannot stimulate gene activity important for mineral absorption. The lack of calcium and phosphate absorption in the intestines slows deposition of these minerals into developing bone (bone mineralization), which leads to soft, weak bones and other features of VDDR2A. Hypocalcemia also causes muscle weakness and seizures in some affected individuals. Most VDR gene mutations impair hair growth, leading to hair loss (alopecia); however, mutations that block VDR's ability to interact with calcitriol do not cause alopecia, indicating that calcitriol is not necessary for the receptor's role in hair development.

            "KRT6B\t   The KRT6B gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 6b or K6b. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of certain cells, particularly cells that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 6b is produced in the nails, the hair follicles, and the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. It is also found in the skin's sebaceous glands, which produce an oily substance called sebum.Keratin 6b partners with a similar protein, keratin 17, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into dense networks that provide strength and resilience to the skin, nails, and other tissues. Networks of keratin intermediate filaments protect these tissues from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.

In most cases, this condition becomes apparent within the first few months of life.One of the mutations associated with pachyonychia congenita changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the keratin 6c protein. Specifically, this mutation replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at protein position 472 (written as Glu472Lys or E472K). The other KRT6C gene mutations delete one or more amino acids from the keratin 6c protein.All of the known KRT6C gene mutations alter the structure of keratin 6c and interfere with the assembly of the keratin intermediate filament network. Without this network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. Even normal activities such as walking can cause skin cells to break down, resulting in the formation of severe, painful blisters and calluses. Additionally, fragile skin cells may abnormally produce more keratin in response to damage, which makes the skin problems worse. Defective keratin 6c also disrupts the growth and function of other tissues, such as the hair follicles and nails, which explains why the signs and symptoms of pachyonychia congenita can also affect these other parts of the body.

            "KRT1\t   The KRT1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 1. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells called keratinocytes that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 1 is produced in keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis), including the skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.The keratin 1 protein partners with another keratin protein, either keratin 9 or keratin 10, to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resiliency to the skin and protect it from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis     Dozens of mutations in the KRT1 gene have been found in people with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. This condition is a skin disorder characterized by red, blistering skin at an early age and thick skin (hyperkeratosis) later in life. People with KRT1 gene mutations typically have PS-type epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which features thick skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar hyperkeratosis) in addition to other parts of the body.Most KRT1 gene mutations associated with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the keratin 1 protein. These amino acid changes commonly occur in regions of the protein that play a role in intermediate filament formation. The mutations alter the keratin 1 protein and seem to affect how intermediate filaments interact with each other to form networks. The altered proteins still form intermediate filaments, but the intermediate filament networks are weaker and do not function normally. Without a strong network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, which can lead to blistering in response to friction or mild trauma. It is unclear how these mutations cause the overgrowth of keratinocytes that results in hyperkeratotic skin. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     KRT1 gene mutations are involved in many other skin disorders. In several of these conditions, there is palmoplantar hyperkeratosis, but the skin on other parts of the body is usually not affected. A condition called epidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma caused by KRT1 gene mutations is relatively mild. Affected individuals typically have palmoplantar hyperkeratosis with detachment or loosening of the epidermis (epidermolysis), usually seen as blistering. People with nonepidermolytic palmoplantar keratoderma have palmoplantar hyperkeratosis with no evidence of epidermolysis. In striate palmoplantar keratoderma type 3, the skin thickening on the palms and soles follows a specific pattern.KRT1 gene mutations are also responsible for a skin disorder called Curth-Macklin ichthyosis hystrix. This condition involves severe hyperkeratosis on the palms and soles and sometimes the skin over large joints or on the torso. This condition is distinguished by specific changes in the keratinocytes.Another skin condition caused by genetic changes in the KRT1 gene called cyclic ichthyosis with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is similar to epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, but the skin changes disappear for short periods, then recur. The recurrent skin changes can last for weeks or months.

            "ATN1\t   The ATN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called atrophin 1.  Although the exact function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in many areas of the brain.  Based on studies in other animals, researchers speculate that atrophin 1 may act as a transcriptional co-repressor.  A transcriptional co-repressor is a protein that interacts with other DNA-binding proteins to suppress the activity of certain genes, although it cannot attach (bind) to DNA by itself.One region of the ATN1 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat.  This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row.  In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the ATN1 gene ranges from 6 to 35.

In people with this condition, the CAG segment is abnormally repeated at least 48 times, and the repeat region may be two or three times its usual length. Although the extended CAG region changes the structure of atrophin 1, it is unclear how the altered protein damages brain cells. Researchers believe that abnormal atrophin 1 accumulates in neurons and interferes with normal cell functions. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in many parts of the brain lead to involuntary movements, intellectual decline, and the other characteristic features of DRPLA.

            "EMG1\t   The EMG1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in the production of cellular structures called ribosomes, which process the cell's genetic instructions to create new proteins. Ribosomes are assembled in a cell compartment called the nucleolus.The EMG1 protein is involved in the assembly of a part of the ribosome called the small subunit (SSU). In this role, the EMG1 protein functions as part of a protein complex called the SSU processome. In addition to helping to assemble the SSU, the SSU processome is involved in the maturation of a molecule called 18S rRNA, which is a chemical cousin of DNA that is incorporated into the SSU.

            "KCNC2\t   From NCBI Gene:The Shaker gene family of Drosophila encodes components of voltage-gated potassium channels and is comprised of four subfamilies. Based on sequence similarity, this gene is similar to one of these subfamilies, namely the Shaw subfamily. The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the delayed rectifier class of channel proteins and is an integral membrane protein that mediates the voltage-dependent potassium ion permeability of excitable membranes. Several transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, May 2012]From UniProt:Voltage-gated potassium channel that mediates transmembrane potassium transport in excitable membranes, primarily in the brain. Contributes to the regulation of the fast action potential repolarization and in sustained high-frequency firing in neurons of the central nervous system. Homotetramer channels mediate delayed-rectifier voltage-dependent potassium currents that activate rapidly at high-threshold voltages and inactivate slowly. Forms tetrameric channels through which potassium ions pass in accordance with their electrochemical gradient. The channel alternates between opened and closed conformations in response to the voltage difference across the membrane (PubMed:15709110). Can form functional homotetrameric and heterotetrameric channels that contain variable proportions of KCNC1, and possibly other family members as well; channel properties depend on the type of alpha subunits that are part of the channel. Channel properties may be modulated either by the association with ancillary subunits, such as KCNE1, KCNE2 or KCNE3 or indirectly by nitric oxide (NO) through a cGMP- and PKG-mediated signaling cascade, slowing channel activation and deactivation of delayed rectifier potassium channels (By similarity). Contributes to fire sustained trains of very brief action potentials at high frequency in retinal ganglion cells, thalamocortical and suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neurons and in hippocampal and neocortical interneurons (PubMed:15709110). Sustained maximal action potential firing frequency in inhibitory hippocampal interneurons is negatively modulated by histamine H2 receptor activation in a cAMP- and protein kinase (PKA) phosphorylation-dependent manner. Plays a role in maintaining the fidelity of synaptic transmission in neocortical GABAergic interneurons by generating action potential (AP) repolarization at nerve terminals, thus reducing spike-evoked calcium influx and GABA neurotransmitter release. Required for long-range synchronization of gamma oscillations over distance in the neocortex. Contributes to the modulation of the circadian rhythm of spontaneous action potential firing in suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) neurons in a light-dependent manner (By similarity).

            "WNK1\t   The WNK1 gene provides instructions for making multiple versions (isoforms) of the WNK1 protein. The different WNK1 isoforms are important in several functions in the body, including blood pressure regulation and pain sensation.One isoform produced from the WNK1 gene is the full-length version, called the L-WNK1 protein, which is found in cells throughout the body. A different isoform, called the kidney-specific WNK1 protein or KS-WNK1, is found only in kidney cells. The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins act as kinases, which are enzymes that change the activity of other proteins by adding a cluster of oxygen and phosphorus atoms (a phosphate group) at specific positions.The L-WNK1 and KS-WNK1 proteins regulate channels in the cell membrane that control the transport of sodium or potassium into and out of cells. In the kidneys, sodium channels help transport sodium into specialized cells, which then transfer it into the blood. This transfer helps keep sodium in the body through a process called reabsorption. Potassium channels handle excess potassium that has been transferred from the blood into kidney cells. The channels transport potassium out of the cells in a process called secretion, so that it can be removed from the body in urine.The L-WNK1 protein increases sodium reabsorption and decreases potassium secretion, whereas the KS-WNK1 protein has the opposite effect. Sodium and potassium are important for regulating blood pressure, and a balance of L-WNK1 protein and KS-WNK1 protein in the kidneys helps maintain the correct levels of sodium and potassium for healthy blood pressure.Another isoform produced from the WNK1 gene, called the WNK1/HSN2 protein, is found in the cells of the nervous system, including nerve cells that transmit the sensations of pain, temperature, and touch (sensory neurons). The WNK1/HSN2 protein appears to regulate channels in the cell membrane that can transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions). These channels maintain the proper amount of chloride inside cells, which is important for controlling the activation (excitation) of the neurons.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II     Mutations in the WNK1 gene are responsible for one type of hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type II (HSAN2) called HSAN2A. People with HSAN2A lose the ability to feel pain or sense hot and cold. More than a dozen mutations in the WNK1 gene have been identified in people with HSAN2A.

            "ZMYM2\t   The ZMYM2 gene (previously known as ZNF198) provides instructions for making a protein whose function is not clearly understood. It is a member of a family of zinc finger proteins, which contain one or more short regions called zinc finger domains. The zinc finger domains in the ZMYM2 protein are thought to allow it to regulate interactions between other proteins. ZMYM2 is found in the nucleus of the cell, where it likely associates with other proteins. Through these associations, the ZMYM2 protein may be involved in repairing DNA errors, controlling gene activity, or forming structures in the nucleus called PML nuclear bodies that block the growth and division of cells and promote their self-destruction (apoptosis).

This condition is characterized by an increased number of white blood cells (myeloproliferative disorder) and the development of lymphoma, a blood-related cancer that causes tumor formation in the lymph nodes. The myeloproliferative disorder usually develops into another form of blood cancer called acute myeloid leukemia. 8p11 myeloproliferative syndrome most commonly results from a rearrangement (translocation) of genetic material between chromosome 13 and chromosome 8. This genetic change fuses part of the ZMYM2 gene on chromosome 13 with part of the FGFR1 gene on chromosome 8. The translocation is found only in cancer cells.The protein produced from the normal FGFR1 gene can turn on cellular signaling that helps the cell respond to its environment, for example by stimulating cell growth. The protein produced from the fused ZMYM2-FGFR1 gene leads to constant FGFR1 signaling. The uncontrolled signaling promotes continuous cell growth and division, leading to cancer.

            "GJB2\t   The GJB2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called gap junction beta 2, more commonly known as connexin 26.  Connexin 26 is a member of the connexin protein family. Connexin proteins form channels called gap junctions that permit the transport of nutrients, charged atoms (ions), and signaling molecules between adjoining cells. The size of the gap junction and the types of particles that move through it are determined by the particular connexin proteins that make up the channel. Gap junctions made with connexin 26 transport potassium ions and certain small molecules.Connexin 26 is found in cells throughout the body, including the inner ear. Because of its presence in the inner ear, especially the snail-shaped structure called the cochlea, researchers are interested in this protein's role in hearing. Hearing requires the conversion of sound waves to electrical nerve impulses. This conversion involves many processes, including maintenance of the proper level of potassium ions in the inner ear. Some studies indicate that channels made with connexin 26 help to maintain the correct level of potassium ions. Other research suggests that connexin 26 is required for the maturation of certain cells in the cochlea.Connexin 26 is also found in the skin. It is thought to play a role in the growth, maturation, and stability of the skin's outermost layer, the epidermis.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Bart-Pumphrey syndrome     At least two GJB2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Bart-Pumphrey syndrome. This condition is characterized by a white discoloration of the nails (leukonychia), thickened skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma), wart-like growths (knuckle pads) on the knuckles of the fingers and toes, and hearing loss.  The GJB2 gene mutations that cause Bart-Pumphrey syndrome replace the protein building block (amino acid) glycine with the amino acid serine at protein position 59 (Gly59Ser or G59S) or replace the amino acid asparagine with the amino acid lysine at protein position 54 (Asn54Lys or N54K). The altered protein probably disrupts the function of normal connexin 26 in cells. This disruption could affect skin growth and also impair hearing by disturbing the conversion of sound waves to nerve impulses. More About This Health Condition      Hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness     At least one GJB2 gene mutation has been identified in people with hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (HID), a disorder characterized by dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis) and hearing loss that is usually profound. This mutation replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 50, written as Asp50Asn or D50N.  The mutation is thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. Death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the signs and symptoms of HID.Because the D50N mutation can also cause keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome (described below), many researchers categorize KID syndrome and HID as a single disorder, which they call KID/HID. It is not known why some people with this gene mutation have eye problems while others do not. More About This Health Condition      Keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness syndrome     At least nine GJB2 gene mutations have been identified in people with keratitis-ichthyosis-deafness (KID) syndrome, with the most common being the D50N mutation that also occurs in hystrix-like ichthyosis with deafness (described above). KID syndrome is characterized by keratitis, which is inflammation of the front surface of the eye (the cornea); thick, reddened patches of dry and scaly skin (ichthyosis); and deafness.The GJB2 gene mutations that cause KID syndrome change single amino acids in connexin 26. The mutations are thought to result in channels that constantly leak ions, which impairs the health of the cells and increases cell death. Death of cells in the skin and the inner ear may underlie the ichthyosis and deafness that occur in KID syndrome. It is unclear how GJB2 gene mutations affect the eye. More About This Health Condition      Nonsyndromic hearing loss     Researchers have identified more than 100 GJB2 gene mutations that can cause nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene can cause two forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss: DFNB1 and DFNA3.DFNB1 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the GJB2 gene are mutated in each cell. This form of the condition accounts for about half of all cases of autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing loss. It is characterized by mild to profound hearing loss that is present before a child learns to speak (prelingual) and does not become more severe over time.Some of the mutations that cause DFNB1 delete or insert DNA building blocks (base pairs) within or near the GJB2 gene. The most common mutation in many populations, particularly in people of northern European descent, deletes one base pair at position 35 in the GJB2 gene (written as 35delG). In Asian populations, a frequently reported mutation deletes a base pair at position 235 (235delC). Among people with eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish ancestry, the deletion of a single base pair at position 167 (167delT) is a common mutation. Less frequently, GJB2 gene mutations that cause DFNB1 replace one base pair with an incorrect one or delete a segment of DNA near the gene.The GJB2 gene mutations that result in DFNB1 are described as \"loss of function\" because they lead to an altered or nonfunctional version of connexin 26, which appears to disrupt the assembly or function of gap junctions. In the inner ear, the abnormal or missing gap junctions likely alter the levels of potassium ions, which may affect the function and survival of cells that are needed for hearing.DFNA3 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one mutated copy of the GJB2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. This form of hearing loss can be either prelingual or begin after a child learns to speak (postlingual). The hearing loss ranges from mild to profound, becomes more severe over time, and particularly affects the ability to hear high-frequency sounds.The GJB2 gene mutations that cause DFNA3 replace one amino acid in connexin 26 with an incorrect amino acid. These mutations are described as \"dominant negative,\" which means that they lead to an abnormal version of connexin 26 that prevents the formation of any functional gap junctions. An absence of these channels probably affects the function and survival of cells in the inner ear that are essential for hearing. More About This Health Condition      Palmoplantar keratoderma with deafness     At least nine GJB2 gene mutations have been identified in people with palmoplantar keratoderma with deafness, a condition characterized by hearing loss and unusually thick skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet.  The GJB2 gene mutations that cause this condition change single amino acids in connexin 26. The altered protein probably disrupts the function of normal connexin 26 in cells and may interfere with the function of other connexin proteins. This disruption could affect skin growth and also impair hearing by disturbing the conversion of sound waves to nerve impulses. More About This Health Condition      Vohwinkel syndrome     At least three GJB2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Vohwinkel syndrome, a condition characterized by hearing loss and skin abnormalities. In addition to abnormal patches of skin, affected individuals develop tight bands of abnormal fibrous tissue around their fingers and toes that may cut off the circulation to the digits and result in spontaneous amputation.

            "SGCG\t   The SGCG gene provides instructions for making the gamma component (subunit) of a group of proteins called the sarcoglycan protein complex. The sarcoglycan protein complex is located in the membrane surrounding muscle cells. It helps maintain the structure of muscle tissue by attaching (binding) to and stabilizing the dystrophin complex, which is made up of proteins called dystrophins and dystroglycans. The large dystrophin complex strengthens muscle fibers and protects them from injury as muscles tense (contract) and relax. It acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix).

            "FLT3\t   The FLT3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3), which is part of a family of proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Receptor tyrosine kinases transmit signals from the cell surface into the cell through a process called signal transduction. The FLT3 protein is found in the outer membrane of certain cell types where a specific protein called FLT3 ligand, or FL, can attach (bind) to it. This binding turns on (activates) the FLT3 protein, which subsequently activates a series of proteins inside the cell that are part of multiple signaling pathways. The signaling pathways stimulated by the FLT3 protein control many important cellular processes such as the growth and division (proliferation) and survival of cells, particularly of early blood cells called hematopoietic progenitor cells.

More About This Health Condition      Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia     Changes in the FLT3 gene are involved in a form of blood cancer known as cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN-AML). While large chromosomal abnormalities can be involved in the development of acute myeloid leukemia, about half of cases do not have these abnormalities; these are classified as CN-AML.The FLT3 gene mutations involved in CN-AML are called somatic mutations; they are found only in cells that become cancerous and are not inherited. Two types of FLT3 gene mutations are found in CN-AML. The most common, which occurs in up to 34 percent of CN-AML cases, is called the FLT3 internal tandem duplication (FLT3-ITD). In this type of mutation, a short sequence of DNA is copied and inserted directly following the original sequence. The duplicated DNA sequence can vary in size, but all FLT3-ITD mutations result in alterations in the region of the protein that spans the cell membrane, known as the juxtamembrane domain. The altered juxtamembrane domain allows the FLT3 receptor to activate signaling pathways without binding of FL; the receptor is always turned on and is said to be constitutively activated. Constant signaling leads to uncontrolled proliferation of abnormal, immature white blood cells, a hallmark of acute myeloid leukemia.The other type of FLT3 gene mutation is found in about 14 percent of people with CN-AML. These mutations are referred to as FLT3-TKD mutations because they change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region of the protein known as the tyrosine kinase domain (TKD). The most commonly changed amino acid is asparagine at position 835; it is typically replaced by the amino acid tyrosine. This mutation is written as Asp835Tyr or D835Y. Like FLT3-ITD mutations, FLT3-TKD mutations result in a constitutively activated FLT3 receptor and constant signaling, leading to acute myeloid leukemia.

            "B3GLCT\t   The B3GLCT gene (formerly known as B3GALTL) provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta 3-glucosyltransferase (B3Glc-T), which is involved in the complex process of adding sugar molecules to proteins (glycosylation). Glycosylation modifies proteins so they can perform a wider variety of functions. The B3Glc-T enzyme is involved in a two-step glycosylation pathway that results in the formation of a sugar structure, made up of the sugars fucose and glucose, on a specific location of several different proteins. The B3Glc-T enzyme is responsible for the second step, which adds a glucose molecule to the fucose molecule already attached to the protein. The B3GLCT gene is normally turned on (active) in most cells of the body, which suggests that the B3Glc-T enzyme plays an important role across many cell types.

The most common B3GLCT gene mutation replaces the DNA building block (nucleotide) guanine with the nucleotide adenine near an area of the gene called exon 8 (written as 660+1G>A). This mutation disrupts how genetic information is pieced together to produce the B3Glc-T enzyme. The resulting enzyme is abnormally short and nonfunctional. It is unclear how the loss of functional B3Glc-T enzyme leads to the signs and symptoms of Peters plus syndrome, but impaired glycosylation likely disrupts the function of many proteins, which may contribute to the variety of features.

            "KL\t   The KL gene provides instructions for making the protein alpha-klotho, which is found primarily in kidney cells. This protein plays a major role in regulating the phosphate levels within the body (phosphate homeostasis). Among its many functions, phosphate plays a critical role in the formation and growth of bones in childhood and helps maintain bone strength in adults. Phosphate levels are controlled in large part by the kidneys. The kidneys normally rid the body of excess phosphate by excreting it in urine, and they reabsorb this mineral into the bloodstream when more is needed.Alpha-klotho attaches (binds) to and turns on (activates) a protein called FGF receptor 1 that spans the membrane of many types of cells, including kidney cells. Once the receptor is active, another protein called fibroblast growth factor 23 can also bind to it. Binding of fibroblast growth factor 23 to its receptor stimulates signaling that stops phosphate reabsorption into the bloodstream.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis     At least one mutation in the KL gene has been found to cause hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC), a condition characterized by an increase in the levels of phosphate in the blood (hyperphosphatemia) and abnormal deposits of phosphate and calcium (calcinosis) in the body's tissues. The KL gene mutation that causes HFTC replaces the protein building block (amino acid) histidine with the amino acid arginine at position 193 in the protein sequence (written as His193Arg or H193R). This mutation results in a shortage of functional alpha-klotho. As a result, FGF receptor 1 is not activated, making it unavailable for fibroblast growth factor 23 binding. The fibroblast growth factor 23 protein is normal, but it cannot bind to its receptor and cannot send out signals to stop phosphate reabsorption. As a result, too much phosphate is reabsorbed into the bloodstream, leading to hyperphosphatemia and subsequent calcinosis.

            "FREM2\t   The FREM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group of proteins called the FRAS/FREM complex; in addition to being part of the complex, FREM2 regulates the complex's formation. The FRAS/FREM complex is found in basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. The complex is particularly important during development before birth. One of its roles is to anchor the top layer of skin by connecting the basement membrane of the top layer to the layer of skin below. The FRAS/FREM complex is also involved in the proper development of certain other organs and tissues, including the kidneys, although the mechanism is unclear.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Fraser syndrome     At least two mutations in the FREM2 gene have been found to cause Fraser syndrome; these mutations are involved in a small percentage of cases of this condition. Fraser syndrome affects development before birth and is characterized by eyes that are completely covered by skin (cryptophthalmos), fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly), and abnormalities of the kidneys and other organs and tissues.FREM2 gene mutations involved in Fraser syndrome lead to production of an abnormal FREM2 protein that likely does not function properly. As a result, the FRAS/FREM complex cannot form. Lack of the FRAS/FREM complex in the basement membrane of skin leads to detachment of the top layer of skin, causing blisters to form during development. These blisters likely prevent the proper formation of certain structures before birth, leading to cryptophthalmos and cutaneous syndactyly. It is unknown how lack of the FRAS/FREM complex leads to kidney abnormalities and other problems in Fraser syndrome.

Such abnormalities are grouped together as congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT). The FREM2 gene mutations involved in CAKUT typically change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the FREM2 protein.

            "ATP7B\t   The ATP7B gene provides instructions for making a protein called copper-transporting ATPase 2.  This protein is part of the P-type ATPase family, a group of proteins that transport metals into and out of cells by using energy stored in the molecule adenosine triphosphate (ATP).  Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found primarily in the liver, with smaller amounts in the kidneys and brain. It plays a role in the transport of copper from the liver to other parts of the body.  Copper is an important part of certain enzymes that maintain normal cell functions.  Copper-transporting ATPase 2 is also important for the removal of excess copper from the body.Within liver cells, copper-transporting ATPase 2 is found in a structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced enzymes and other proteins.  Here, copper-transporting ATPase 2 supplies copper to a protein  called ceruloplasmin, which transports copper to other parts of the body via the blood.  If copper levels in the liver get too high, copper-transporting ATPase 2 leaves the Golgi and transfers copper to small sacs (vesicles) for elimination through bile.  Bile is a substance produced by the liver that is important for digestion and the removal of waste products.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Wilson disease     Researchers have identified more than 250 ATP7B gene mutations that cause Wilson disease.  About half the mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make copper-transporting ATPase 2.  This type of mutation alters the 3-dimensional structure of the protein or its stability, preventing copper-transporting ATPase 2 from functioning properly.  A common amino acid substitution replaces the amino acid histidine with the amino acid glutamine at position 1069 in the protein (written as His1069Gln or H1069Q).  This particular mutation occurs in nearly 40 percent of affected individuals with a Northern or Eastern European ancestry.  Approximately one-third of Asians with Wilson disease have a mutation that replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid leucine at position 778 (written as Arg778Leu or R778L).  In the Costa Rican population, more than 60 percent of affected individuals have a mutation that replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid serine at position 1270 (written as Asp1270Ser or D1270S).Other types of mutations delete or insert small segments of DNA within the ATP7B gene or introduce a stop signal in the gene's instructions for making copper-transporting ATPase 2.  As a result, no protein is produced, or an abnormally small protein is made.  These types of mutations usually result in  symptoms that are more severe than those caused by mutations that change a single amino acid.With a shortage of functional protein, removal of excess copper from the body is impaired.  As a result, copper accumulates to toxic levels that can damage tissues and organs, particularly the liver and brain.

This protein is indirectly involved in the non-cell autonomous inhibitory effect on fibroblast growth factor two signaling. The protein interacts with Cas-Br-M (murine) ectropic retroviral transforming sequence, and can function as a bimodal regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor/mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling.

            "TRAC\t   From NCBI Gene:T cell receptors recognize foreign antigens which have been processed as small peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules at the surface of antigen presenting cells (APC). Each T cell receptor is a dimer consisting of one alpha and one beta chain or one delta and one gamma chain. In a single cell, the T cell receptor loci are rearranged and expressed in the order delta, gamma, beta, and alpha. If both delta and gamma rearrangements produce functional chains, the cell expresses delta and gamma. If not, the cell proceeds to rearrange the beta and alpha loci. This region represents the germline organization of the T cell receptor alpha and delta loci. Both the alpha and delta loci include V (variable), J (joining), and C (constant) segments and the delta locus also includes diversity (D) segments. The delta locus is situated within the alpha locus, between the alpha V and J segments. During T cell development, the delta chain is synthesized by a recombination event at the DNA level joining a D segment with a J segment; a V segment is then joined to the D-J gene. The alpha chain is synthesized by recombination joining a single V segment with a J segment. For both chains, the C segment is later joined by splicing at the RNA level. Recombination of many different V segments with several J segments provides a wide range of antigen recognition. Additional diversity is attained by junctional diversity, resulting from the random additional of nucleotides by terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase. Five variable segments can be used in either alpha or delta chains and are described by TRAV/DV symbols. Several V and J segments of the alpha locus are known to be incapable of encoding a protein and are considered pseudogenes.

            "MYH6\t   The MYH6 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as the cardiac alpha (α)-myosin heavy chain. This protein is found in heart (cardiac) muscle cells, where it forms part of a larger protein called type II myosin. Type II myosin helps generate the mechanical force that is needed for cardiac muscle to contract, allowing the heart to pump blood to the rest of the body.Type II myosin is one of the major components of cell structures called sarcomeres. These structures are the basic units of muscle contraction. Sarcomeres are composed of thick filaments made up of type II myosin and thin filaments made up of another protein called actin. The overlapping thick and thin filaments attach to each other and release, which allows the filaments to move relative to one another so that muscles can contract. Sarcomeres also appear to have an important role in the early development of structures in the heart.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Sick sinus syndrome     At least one variation of the MYH6 gene has been associated with an increased risk of developing sick sinus syndrome. This condition affects the function of the sino-atrial (SA) node, which is an area of specialized cells in the heart that functions as a natural pacemaker. The variation, which was identified in the Icelandic population, changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the α-myosin heavy chain. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 721 (written as Arg721Trp). Researchers found that about half of the people in their sample who had the Arg721Trp variation developed sick sinus syndrome during their lifetime, compared with about 6 percent of people who did not carry the variation. They speculated that the variation may alter the structure of the α-myosin heavy chain and disrupt its usual role in cardiac muscle contraction. These changes could alter the way the heart beats in some people, leading to an abnormally slow heartbeat (bradycardia) and related symptoms such as dizziness, light-headedness, and fainting (syncope). More About This Health Condition      Familial dilated cardiomyopathy     Genetics Home Reference provides information about familial dilated cardiomyopathy. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Mutations in the MYH6 gene have been found to cause several additional heart conditions. These include congenital heart defects, particularly atrial-septal defect (ASD), which is a hole in the wall (septum) that separates the two upper chambers of the heart (the atria). Most of the MYH6 gene mutations associated with ASD affect a part of the α-myosin heavy chain known as the head domain. This part of the protein is involved in attaching (binding) type II myosin to actin. Abnormal interaction between these two proteins may disrupt early heart development, leading to heart defects such as ASD.MYH6 gene mutations can also cause two diseases of the cardiac muscle, dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). DCM weakens and enlarges the heart, while HCM is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the cardiac muscle. Both of these conditions prevent the heart from pumping blood efficiently and increase the risk of heart failure and sudden death. Mutations associated with DCM and HCM can affect any part of the α-myosin heavy chain, and most change single amino acids in the protein. These changes likely alter the α-myosin heavy chain in ways that affect the structure and function of cardiac muscle.

            "CHMP4A\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a member of the chromatin-modifying protein/charged multivesicular body protein (CHMP) protein family. The protein is part of the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) complex III (ESCRT-III), which functions in the sorting of endocytosed cell-surface receptors into multivesicular endosomes. The ESCRT machinery also functions in the final abscisson stage of cytokinesis and in the budding of enveloped viruses such as HIV-1. The three proteins of the CHMP4 subfamily interact with programmed cell death 6 interacting protein (PDCD6IP, also known as ALIX), which also functions in the ESCRT pathway. The CHMP4 proteins assemble into membrane-attached 5-nm filaments that form circular scaffolds and promote or stabilize outward budding. These polymers are proposed to help generate the luminal vesicles of multivesicular bodies. Mutations in this gene result in autosomal dominant posterior polar cataracts.[provided by RefSeq, Oct 2009]From UniProt:(Microbial infection) The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the budding of enveloped viruses (HIV-1 and other lentiviruses). Via its interaction with PDCD6IP involved in HIV-1 p6- and p9-dependent virus release.Probable core component of the endosomal sorting required for transport complex III (ESCRT-III) which is involved in multivesicular bodies (MVBs) formation and sorting of endosomal cargo proteins into MVBs. MVBs contain intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) that are generated by invagination and scission from the limiting membrane of the endosome and mostly are delivered to lysosomes enabling degradation of membrane proteins, such as stimulated growth factor receptors, lysosomal enzymes and lipids. The MVB pathway appears to require the sequential function of ESCRT-O, -I,-II and -III complexes. ESCRT-III proteins mostly dissociate from the invaginating membrane before the ILV is released (PubMed:12860994, PubMed:18209100). The ESCRT machinery also functions in topologically equivalent membrane fission events, such as the terminal stages of cytokinesis (PubMed:21310966). Together with SPAST, the ESCRT-III complex promotes nuclear envelope sealing and mitotic spindle disassembly during late anaphase (PubMed:26040712). Plays a role in the endosomal sorting pathway. ESCRT-III proteins are believed to mediate the necessary vesicle extrusion and/or membrane fission activities, possibly in conjunction with the AAA ATPase VPS4. When overexpressed, membrane-assembled circular arrays of CHMP4B filaments can promote or stabilize negative curvature and outward budding. CHMP4A/B/C are required for the exosomal release of SDCBP, CD63 and syndecan (PubMed:22660413).

            "TGM1\t   The TGM1 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called transglutaminase 1. This enzyme is found in cells that make up the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). Transglutaminase 1 is involved in the formation of the cornified cell envelope, which is a structure that surrounds skin cells and helps form a protective barrier between the body and its environment. Specifically, transglutaminase 1 forms strong bonds, called cross-links, between the structural proteins that make up the cornified cell envelope. This cross-linking provides strength and stability to the epidermis.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Lamellar ichthyosis     Many mutations in the TGM1 gene have been found to cause lamellar ichthyosis, which is a condition that causes scaly skin that covers much of the body, and other skin abnormalities. Some TGM1 gene mutations that cause this condition change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the transglutaminase 1 enzyme. The most frequently occurring mutation (written as 877-2A>G) affects the way the gene's instructions are pieced together to form the enzyme and results in an abnormally shortened, nonfunctional enzyme. Other TGM1 gene mutations result in a transglutaminase 1 enzyme that cannot function normally, is abnormally short, or is not produced. A lack of functional transglutaminase 1 prevents the formation of the cornified cell envelope, causing the skin abnormalities of lamellar ichthyosis. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     In addition to lamellar ichthyosis (described above), TGM1 gene mutations have been found to cause other forms of ichthyosis. In one type, called self-healing collodion baby, affected infants are born with a tight, clear sheath covering their skin called a collodion membrane. This membrane usually dries and peels off during the first few weeks of life, and affected infants often show near normal skin within a few months. Another type of ichthyosis, called bathing suit ichthyosis, is characterized by scaly skin that is limited to the trunk.

            "ATXN3\t   The ATXN3 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called ataxin-3, which is found in cells throughout the body. Ataxin-3 is involved in a mechanism called the ubiquitin-proteasome system that destroys and gets rid of excess or damaged proteins. The molecule ubiquitin attaches (binds) to unneeded proteins and tags them to be broken down (degraded) within cells. Ataxin-3 removes (cleaves) the ubiquitin from these unwanted proteins just before they are degraded so that the ubiquitin can be used again. Due to its role in cleaving ubiquitin from proteins, ataxin-3 is known as a deubiquitinating enzyme.Researchers believe that ataxin-3 also may be involved in regulating the first stage of protein production (transcription).

SCA3 results from a mutation in the ATXN3 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN3 gene. People with SCA3 have more than 50 CAG repeats.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin-3 protein that folds into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. This nonfunctional ataxin-3 protein cannot remove ubiquitin from proteins that are no longer needed. As a result, these unwanted proteins, along with ubiquitin and ataxin-3, cluster together to form clumps (aggregates) within the nucleus of the cells. It is unclear how these aggregates affect cell function, because they are found in healthy cells as well as those that die.Nerve cells (neurons) and other types of brain cells are most affected by mutations in the ATXN3 gene. SCA3 is associated with cell death in the part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord (the brainstem), the part of the brain involved in coordinating movements (the cerebellum), and other areas of the brain.

            "OCA2\t   The OCA2 gene (formerly called the P gene) provides instructions for making a protein called the P protein. This protein is located in melanocytes, which are specialized cells that produce a pigment called melanin. Melanin is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Although the exact function of the P protein is unknown, it is essential for normal pigmentation and is likely involved in the production of melanin. Within melanocytes, the P protein may transport molecules into and out of structures called melanosomes (where melanin is produced).  Researchers believe that this protein may also help regulate the relative acidity (pH) of melanosomes.  Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological processes.

People with this form of albinism often have light yellow, blond, or light brown hair; creamy white skin; light-colored eyes; and problems with vision. The most common OCA2 mutation is a large deletion in the gene, which is found in many affected individuals of sub-Saharan African heritage. Other OCA2 gene mutations, including changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) and small deletions, are more common in other populations. Mutations in the OCA2 gene disrupt the normal production of melanin, which reduces coloring of the hair, skin, and eyes and affects vision. More About This Health Condition      Angelman syndrome     The OCA2 gene is located in a region of chromosome 15 that is often deleted in individuals with Angelman syndrome. A loss of this gene does not cause the characteristic neurologic features of Angelman syndrome; however, people with this condition who are missing one copy of the OCA2 gene tend to have unusually light-colored hair and fair skin. Cells with only one copy of the OCA2 gene make a reduced amount of P protein compared with cells with two functional copies of this gene, which affects the coloring of the hair and skin.A small percentage of people with Angelman syndrome also have oculocutaneous albinism type 2. This condition occurs when people have two nonfunctional copies of the OCA2 gene in each cell. In addition to a deletion in chromosome 15 that removes one copy of the OCA2 gene, these individuals have a mutation in the OCA2 gene on the other copy of chromosome 15. As a result, cells make little or no functional P protein. A lack of P protein disrupts the production of melanin, leading to the characteristic features of albinism.

            "TRPM1\t   The TRPM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 1 (TRPM1). This protein acts as a channel, transporting positively charged atoms (cations) into cells. The TRPM1 channel is found on the surface of two types of cells: pigment-producing cells called melanocytes and specialized bipolar cells in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina).In melanocytes, the TRPM1 channel is thought to play a role in the production of a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color (pigmentation). It is unclear what role the channel plays, but increased channel activity is associated with greater melanin production and darker pigmentation.In bipolar cells, TRPM1 channels are involved in the pathway that receives visual signals from cells called rods, which are used to see in low light. This signaling is an essential step in the transmission of visual information from the eyes to the brain. In low-light conditions, visual signals from rod cells trigger the TRPM1 channels to close, which causes visual signals to be transmitted.

            "EIF2AK4\t   The EIF2AK4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that helps direct a cell's response to changes that could damage the cell. This protein is found in several tissues throughout the body, including blood vessel walls. The EIF2AK4 protein can turn on (activate) another protein called eIF2 alpha (eIF2α), which helps control protein production. When cells are under stress, for example when the level of protein building blocks (amino acids) is too low, EIF2AK4 activates eIF2α. When turned on, eIF2α stimulates processes that reduce protein production, which helps conserve amino acids. In addition, activated eIF2α can trigger production of certain proteins called transcription factors, which control gene activity. The transcription factors regulated by eIF2α control the activity of genes involved in processes that help reduce the stress on the cell.

In PVOD, excess fibrous tissue builds up in the small vessels in the lungs that carry oxygenated blood from the lungs to the heart (the pulmonary veins). This buildup narrows (occludes) the vessels and impairs blood flow. Because blood flow through the lungs is difficult, pressure rises in the vessels that carry blood that needs to be oxygenated to the lungs from the heart (pulmonary arteries). Increased pressure in these vessels is known as pulmonary arterial hypertension.The EIF2AK4 gene mutations involved in PVOD likely lead to a complete loss of functional protein.

The encoded protein functions as a scaffold for proteins that influence the spindle assembly checkpoint during the eukaryotic cell cycle and it interacts with at least five different kinetochore proteins and two checkpoint kinases. In adults, this gene is predominantly expressed in normal testes, various cancer cell lines and primary tumors from other tissues and is ubiquitously expressed in fetal tissues. This gene was originally identified as a fusion partner with the mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL) gene in t(11;15)(q23;q14). Mutations in this gene cause autosomal recessive primary microcephaly-4 (MCPH4). Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms.

The CATSPER2 protein plays a role in sperm cell movement (motility) and is required for sperm cells to push through the outside membrane of the egg cell during fertilization. The CATSPER2 protein is embedded in the membrane of the sperm tail and is necessary in order for positively charged calcium atoms (calcium cations) to enter the cell. Calcium cations are needed for a type of sperm motility called hyperactivation.

            "ACAN\t   The ACAN gene provides instructions for making the aggrecan protein. Aggrecan is a type of protein known as a proteoglycan, which means it has several sugar molecules attached to it. It is the most abundant proteoglycan in cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways, and external ears.Aggrecan attaches to the other components of cartilage, organizing the network of molecules that gives cartilage its strength. These interactions occur at a specific region of the aggrecan protein called the C-type lectin domain (CLD). Because of the attached sugars, aggrecan attracts water molecules and gives cartilage its gel-like structure. This feature enables the cartilage to resist compression, protecting bones and joints. Although its role is unclear, aggrecan affects bone development.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Familial osteochondritis dissecans     At least one mutation in the ACAN gene has been found to cause familial osteochondritis dissecans. This condition is characterized by areas of bone damage (lesions) caused by the detachment of cartilage and some of the underlying bone from the end of the bone at a joint. People with familial osteochondritis dissecans have multiple lesions that affect the knees, elbows, hips, or ankles. Other common features are short stature and early development of a painful joint disorder called osteoarthritis.The ACAN gene mutation associated with this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the CLD of the aggrecan protein. Specifically, the amino acid valine is replaced by the amino acid methionine at protein position 2303 (written as Val2303Met or V2303M). The abnormal aggrecan protein is unable to attach to other components of cartilage. As a result, the cartilage is disorganized and weak. It is unclear how the abnormal cartilage is involved in the development of the lesions and osteoarthritis characteristic of familial osteochondritis dissecans. Researchers have suggested that a disorganized cartilage network in growing bones impairs their growth, leading to short stature. More About This Health Condition      Intervertebral disc disease     Genetics Home Reference provides information about intervertebral disc disease. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Two other conditions associated with short stature, called spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type, are caused by mutations in the ACAN gene. People with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type have extremely short stature, short fingers and toes, and distinctive facial features. This condition is caused by a mutation that changes the amino acid at position 2267 in the aggrecan protein from aspartic acid to asparagine (written as Asp2267Asn or D2267N). The amino acid change, which occurs in the CLD, alters aggrecan's interaction with at least one component of the cartilage network. It is unclear how this change leads to the particular signs and symptoms of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type.Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type is characterized by short stature and early development of osteoarthritis, particularly in the knees, ankles, and hips. This condition is caused by a mutation in which a single DNA building block is inserted into the ACAN gene, which could disrupt the gene's instructions and lead to the production of an abnormally short aggrecan protein that is missing the CLD. It is unknown if the abnormal protein is produced or what effects it might have. It is unclear what role this gene mutation plays in the development of the specific features of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type.

More About This Health Condition  Two other conditions associated with short stature, called spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type and spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type, are caused by mutations in the ACAN gene. People with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type have extremely short stature, short fingers and toes, and distinctive facial features. This condition is caused by a mutation that changes the amino acid at position 2267 in the aggrecan protein from aspartic acid to asparagine (written as Asp2267Asn or D2267N). The amino acid change, which occurs in the CLD, alters aggrecan's interaction with at least one component of the cartilage network. It is unclear how this change leads to the particular signs and symptoms of spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia, aggrecan type.Spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type is characterized by short stature and early development of osteoarthritis, particularly in the knees, ankles, and hips. This condition is caused by a mutation in which a single DNA building block is inserted into the ACAN gene, which could disrupt the gene's instructions and lead to the production of an abnormally short aggrecan protein that is missing the CLD. It is unknown if the abnormal protein is produced or what effects it might have. It is unclear what role this gene mutation plays in the development of the specific features of spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia, Kimberley type.

            "POLG\t   The POLG gene provides instructions for making the active piece, called the alpha subunit, of a protein called polymerase gamma (pol γ). To be most effective, the alpha subunit attaches to two copies of another protein called the beta subunit to form pol γ. Pol γ is a DNA polymerase, which is a type of enzyme that \"reads\" sequences of DNA and uses them as templates to produce new DNA. These enzymes are important for copying (replicating) cells' genetic material. DNA polymerases also play critical roles in DNA repair.Pol γ functions in mitochondria. Mitochondria are structures within cells in which a process called oxidative phosphorylation converts the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Mitochondria each contain a small amount of DNA, known as mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), which is essential for the normal function of these structures. Pol γ is the only DNA polymerase that is active in mitochondria and that can replicate mtDNA.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome     There are many mutations in the POLG gene that cause Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is part of a group of conditions called POLG-related disorders that have overlapping signs and symptoms affecting muscle-, nerve-, and brain-related functions. Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome is characterized by seizures, loss of mental and movement abilities (psychomotor regression), and liver disease. The liver disease in Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome can be brought on or made worse by valproic acid, a common treatment for seizures.Most POLG gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the alpha subunit of pol γ. The mutations can have several effects on the function of pol γ. The alpha subunit may lose the ability to attach to the beta subunits to form pol γ. Alternately, mutated pol γ may be unable to bind the existing mtDNA strand to use as a template. Or, it may have a reduced ability to attract the DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that it uses to form new DNA. These effects impair DNA synthesis and may lead to insertion of the wrong nucleotide and decreased ability to fix the error.The most common POLG gene mutation in Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid threonine at position 467 (written as Ala467Thr or A467T). This mutation blocks the ability of the alpha subunit to attach to the beta subunits and reduces pol γ's ability to synthesize DNA. The Ala467Thr mutation is also common in other POLG-related disorders. The different conditions may be determined, in part, by the mutation in the other copy of POLG, but there are still some mutation combinations that can cause more than one of the disorders. It is unclear how the same mutation can lead to different conditions.Although the mechanism is unknown, many people with Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome have fewer copies of mtDNA (mtDNA depletion). This abnormality is seen only in the tissues affected by the disease. MtDNA depletion leads to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and a decrease in cellular energy. These impairments affect tissues whose cells do not divide continually, such as brain, muscle, and liver. These tissues are most affected because they are more dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy, and impaired cells in these tissues are not generally replaced by new cells. The lack of energy supplies in these tissues could account for the signs and symptoms of Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Ataxia neuropathy spectrum     Another condition caused by mutations in the POLG gene is ataxia neuropathy spectrum, a POLG-related disorder that is characterized by problems with coordination and balance (ataxia) and disturbances in nerve function (neuropathy). The conditions previously named mitochondrial recessive ataxia syndrome (MIRAS) and sensory ataxia neuropathy dysarthria and ophthalmoplegia (SANDO) are now included in the ataxia neuropathy spectrum.As mentioned above, most mutations in the POLG gene change single amino acids in the alpha subunit of pol γ, and these mutations can have several effects on the function of pol γ. As a result, pol γ has a reduced ability to replicate mtDNA. The most common POLG gene mutation in ataxia neuropathy spectrum is the same as that in Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, Ala467Thr. It is unclear how the same mutation can lead to different disorders.As in other POLG-related disorders, people with ataxia neuropathy spectrum typically have mtDNA depletion in the tissues affected by the condition, such as the brain. MtDNA depletion decreases the amount of energy available to the cell due to reduced oxidative phosphorylation, which may account for the signs and symptoms of ataxia neuropathy spectrum. More About This Health Condition      Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy spectrum     Childhood myocerebrohepatopathy syndrome (MCHS) is also caused by mutations in the POLG gene. MCHS is a POLG-related disorder that affects the muscles (myo-), brain (cerebro-), and liver (hepato-).Many mutations in the POLG gene can cause MCHS. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the alpha subunit of pol γ. These mutations reduce the activity of pol γ, decreasing mtDNA replication.As in other POLG-related disorders, people with MCHS typically have mtDNA depletion in muscle, brain, or liver tissue. MtDNA depletion impairs oxidative phosphorylation in these tissues and decreases the energy available to the cells, which may cause the signs and symptoms of MCHS. More About This Health Condition      Myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia     Mutations in the POLG gene cause another POLG-related disorder called myoclonic epilepsy myopathy sensory ataxia (MEMSA), which is characterized by recurrent seizures (epilepsy), muscle weakness (myopathy), and problems with coordination and balance (ataxia).Most of the POLG gene mutations involved in MEMSA change single amino acids in the alpha subunit of pol γ. These mutations result in a less active form of pol γ that has a reduced ability to replicate mtDNA.As in other POLG-related disorders, people with MEMSA typically have mtDNA depletion in affected tissues, such as muscle or brain. MtDNA depletion leads to impaired oxidative phosphorylation and decreased energy reserves in affected tissues, which may cause the signs and symptoms of MEMSA. More About This Health Condition      Progressive external ophthalmoplegia     Mutations in the POLG gene are frequently responsible for an eye condition called progressive external ophthalmoplegia, another POLG-related disorder. This condition weakens the muscles that control eye movement and causes the eyelids to droop (ptosis).There are at least 67 POLG gene mutations that cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia. Most POLG gene mutations change single amino acids in the alpha subunit of pol γ, which decreases the efficiency of mtDNA replication. As in another POLG-related disorder, Alpers-Huttenlocher syndrome, the most common POLG gene mutation in progressive external ophthalmoplegia is Ala467Thr. It is unclear how the same mutation can lead to different disorders.In progressive external ophthalmoplegia, mutations in the POLG gene result in large deletions of genetic material from mtDNA in muscle tissue, rather than the overall mtDNA depletion seen in other POLG-related disorders. The reason for this difference is unknown. Researchers have not determined how deletions of mtDNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, although the features of the condition are probably related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. It has been suggested that eye muscles are commonly affected by mitochondrial defects because they are especially dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy.

            "MESP2\t   The MESP2 gene provides instructions for making a transcription factor, which is a protein that attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of particular genes.  The MESP2 protein controls the activity of genes in the Notch pathway, an important pathway in embryonic development. The Notch pathway plays a critical role in the development of the bones of the spine (vertebrae). Specifically, the MESP2 protein and the Notch pathway are involved in separating future vertebrae from one another during early development, in a complex process called somite segmentation. Although the exact mechanism of somite segmentation is unclear, it appears to require the activity of several proteins in the Notch pathway, including the NOTCH1 protein and the MESP2 protein, to be turned on and off (oscillate) in a specific pattern.The MESP2 protein regulates Notch activity by turning on (activating) genes in the Notch pathway, which ultimately block (repress) the activity of the NOTCH1 protein. Additionally, through unknown mechanisms, the MESP2 protein seems to mark the boundary separating future vertebrae from one another.

More About This Health Condition      Spondylothoracic dysostosis     At least three mutations in the MESP2 gene have been found to cause spondylothoracic dysostosis, a condition characterized by abnormal development of bones in the spine and ribs.  All of the known mutations replace one protein building block (amino acid) in the protein sequence. The most common mutation replaces the amino acid glutamate with a premature stop signal at position 103 (written as Glu103Ter or E103X). A similar mutation occurs at amino acid position 230 (written as Glu230Ter or E230X). The third mutation replaces the amino acid leucine with the amino acid valine at position 125 (written as Leu125Val or L125V). Most affected individuals have the Glu103Ter mutation in both copies of the MESP2 gene.  However, a few people with spondylothoracic dysostosis have the Glu103Ter mutation in one copy of the MESP2 gene and either the Leu125Val or the Glu230Ter mutation in the other copy.Mutations in the MESP2 gene prevent the production of any protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. When the MESP2 protein is nonfunctional or absent, the NOTCH1 protein is abnormally active and the boundary separating future vertebrae from one another does not form. This results in the malformation and fusion of the bones of the spine and ribs seen in spondylothoracic dysostosis.

            "TPSAB1\t   From NCBI Gene:Tryptases comprise a family of trypsin-like serine proteases, the peptidase family S1. Tryptases are enzymatically active only as heparin-stabilized tetramers, and they are resistant to all known endogenous proteinase inhibitors. Several tryptase genes are clustered on chromosome 16p13.3. These genes are characterized by several distinct features. They have a highly conserved 3' UTR and contain tandem repeat sequences at the 5' flank and 3' UTR which are thought to play a role in regulation of the mRNA stability. These genes have an intron immediately upstream of the initiator Met codon, which separates the site of transcription initiation from protein coding sequence. This feature is characteristic of tryptases but is unusual in other genes. The alleles of this gene exhibit an unusual amount of sequence variation, such that the alleles were once thought to represent two separate genes, alpha and beta 1. Beta tryptases appear to be the main isoenzymes expressed in mast cells; whereas in basophils, alpha tryptases predominate. Tryptases have been implicated as mediators in the pathogenesis of asthma and other allergic and inflammatory disorders.

            "NPRL3\t   The NPRL3 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is one piece of a group of proteins (complex) called GATOR1. This complex is found in cells throughout the body, where it regulates a signaling pathway called the mTOR pathway. The mTOR pathway is involved in cell growth and division (proliferation), the survival of cells, and the creation (synthesis) of new proteins. The role of the GATOR1 complex is to block this pathway by inhibiting (stopping) the activity of a complex called mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) that is integral to the mTOR pathway.In the brain, the mTOR pathway regulates many processes, including the growth and development of nerve cells and their ability to change and adapt over time (plasticity).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Familial focal epilepsy with variable foci     At least ten NPRL3 gene mutations have been found to cause familial focal epilepsy with variable foci (FFEVF), which is an uncommon form of recurrent seizures (epilepsy) that runs in families. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, formation of normal GATOR1 complex is reduced, leading to overactivity of mTORC1 and excessive signaling of the mTOR pathway. It is not clear how an abnormally active mTOR pathway leads to the seizures of FFEVF. Research suggests that increased mTOR pathway signaling in the brain leads to changes in the connections between nerve cells (synapses) and increased activation (excitation) of nerve cells, which can cause seizures.

            "PKD1\t   The PKD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called polycystin-1.  This protein is most active in kidney cells before birth; much less of the protein is made in normal adult kidneys.  Although its exact function is not well understood, polycystin-1 appears to interact with a smaller, somewhat similar protein called polycystin-2.Polycystin-1 spans the cell membrane of kidney cells, so that one end of the protein remains inside the cell and the other end projects from the outer surface of the cell. This positioning of the protein allows it to interact with other proteins, carbohydrates, and fat molecules (lipids) outside the cell and to receive signals that help the cell respond to its environment. When a molecule binds to polycystin-1 on the surface of the cell, the protein interacts with polycystin-2 to trigger a cascade of chemical reactions inside the cell. These chemical reactions instruct the cell to undergo certain changes, such as maturing to take on specialized functions.  Polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 likely work together to help regulate cell growth and division (proliferation), cell movement (migration), and interactions with other cells.Polycystin-1 is also found in cell structures called primary cilia.  Primary cilia are tiny, fingerlike projections that line the small tubes where urine is formed (renal tubules).  Researchers believe that primary cilia sense the movement of fluid through these tubules, which appears to help maintain the tubules' size and structure.  The interaction of polycystin-1 and polycystin-2 in renal tubules promotes the normal development and function of the kidneys.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Polycystic kidney disease     More than 250 mutations in the PKD1 gene have been identified in people with polycystic kidney disease.  These mutations are responsible for about 85 percent of cases of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), which is the most common type of this disorder. Mutations in the PKD1 gene include deletions or insertions of DNA building blocks (base pairs) and alterations of one or more base pairs.  Most PKD1 mutations are predicted to produce an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the polycystin-1 protein. Although researchers are uncertain how a lack of polycystin-1 leads to the formation of cysts, it probably disrupts the protein's signaling function within the cell and in primary cilia.  As a result, cells lining the renal tubules may grow and divide abnormally, leading to the growth of numerous cysts characteristic of polycystic kidney disease.

            "LCAT\t   The LCAT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT). This enzyme plays a role in removing cholesterol from the blood and tissues. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals (particularly egg yolks, meat, poultry, fish, and dairy products). The body needs this substance to build cell membranes, make certain hormones, and produce compounds that aid in fat digestion. Too much cholesterol, however, increases a person's risk of developing heart disease, and can also lead to buildup of cholesterol in other tissues.The LCAT enzyme helps transport cholesterol out of the blood and tissues by a process called cholesterol esterification. This process results in a form of cholesterol that is more efficiently carried by molecules called lipoproteins, which transport the cholesterol to the liver. Once in the liver, the cholesterol is redistributed to other tissues or removed from the body. The enzyme has two major functions, called  alpha- and beta-LCAT activity. Alpha-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to a lipoprotein called high-density lipoprotein (HDL). Beta-LCAT activity helps attach cholesterol to other lipoproteins called very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Complete LCAT deficiency     More than 70 mutations in the LCAT gene have been identified in people with complete LCAT deficiency, a disorder that primarily causes corneal clouding and kidney problems. Individuals with complete LCAT deficiency have mutations in both copies of the LCAT gene in each cell. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the LCAT enzyme sequence. Others add or delete small amounts of genetic material in the LCAT gene. The mutations either prevent the production of LCAT or impair both alpha-LCAT and beta-LCAT activity, reducing the enzyme's ability to attach cholesterol to lipoproteins. Impairment of this mechanism for reducing cholesterol in the body leads to cholesterol deposits in the corneas, kidneys, and other tissues and organs. These deposits cause the signs and symptoms of complete LCAT deficiency. More About This Health Condition      Fish-eye disease     At least 18 mutations in the LCAT gene have been identified in people with fish-eye disease, also called partial LCAT deficiency. This disorder causes clouding of the clear covering of the eyes (corneas). Individuals with fish-eye disease have mutations in both copies of the LCAT gene in each cell. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the LCAT sequence. The mutations impair alpha-LCAT activity, reducing the enzyme's ability to attach cholesterol to HDL. Impairment of this mechanism for reducing cholesterol in the body leads to cholesterol deposits in the corneas that gradually cause them to become cloudy. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     People with one LCAT gene mutation in each cell may have an increased risk of atherosclerosis, which is an accumulation of cholesterol-rich fatty deposits and scar-like tissue in the lining of the arteries that can impede blood flow and lead to heart attacks, strokes, and other health problems. A single LCAT gene mutation likely reduces alpha-LCAT activity and binding of cholesterol to HDL, leading to less efficient transport of cholesterol from the blood and resulting in the development of atherosclerosis.Atherosclerosis also occurs in some people with fish-eye disease or complete LCAT deficiency. However, because atherosclerosis is very common in the general population and both fish-eye disease and complete LCAT deficiency are very rare, it is difficult to determine whether affected individuals are at increased risk of atherosclerosis.

            "JPH3\t   The JPH3 gene provides instructions for making a protein called junctophilin-3, which is found primarily in the brain.  Although the exact function of this protein is unclear, researchers believe that it plays a role in the formation of a structure called the junctional membrane complex.  This complex connects certain channels inside cells with other channels at the cell surface.   The junctional membrane complex appears to be involved in the release of charged calcium atoms (calcium ions), which are critical for transmitting signals within cells.  As part of the junctional membrane complex, junctophilin-3 is probably involved in signaling within and between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.One region of the JPH3 gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG/CTG segment is repeated 6 to 28 times within the gene.

Researchers have named this condition Huntington disease-like 2 (HDL2).The mutation associated with HDL2 increases the size of the CAG/CTG trinucleotide repeat in the JPH3 gene.  People with this condition have 44 to 59 CAG/CTG repeats.  People with 29 to about 43 CAG/CTG repeats  may or may not develop the signs and symptoms of HDL2.Researchers are working to determine the effects of the abnormally large CAG/CTG segment.  They believe that the mutated JPH3 gene produces an altered version of messenger RNA, which is a molecular blueprint of the gene that is normally used for protein production.  The abnormal messenger RNA forms clumps inside neurons that interfere with the normal functions of these cells.  The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL2.

            "CYBA\t   The CYBA gene provides instructions for making a protein called the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain (also known as p22-phox). This protein is one part (subunit) of a group of proteins that forms an enzyme complex called NADPH oxidase, which plays an essential role in the immune system. Within this complex, the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain has a beta chain partner (produced from the CYBB gene). Both alpha and beta chains are required for either to function, and the NADPH oxidase complex requires both chains in order to be functional. NADPH oxidase is primarily active in immune system cells called phagocytes. These cells catch and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and fungi. NADPH oxidase is also thought to regulate the activity of immune cells called neutrophils. These cells play a role in adjusting the inflammatory response to optimize healing and reduce injury to the body.The presence of foreign invaders stimulates phagocytes and triggers the assembly of NADPH oxidase. This enzyme participates in a chemical reaction that converts oxygen to a toxic molecule called superoxide. Superoxide is used to generate several other compounds, including hydrogen peroxide (a strong disinfectant) and hypochlorous acid (the active ingredient in bleach). These highly reactive, toxic substances are known as reactive oxygen species. Phagocytes use these substances to kill foreign invaders, preventing them from reproducing in the body and causing illness.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Chronic granulomatous disease     More than 40 mutations in the CYBA gene have been found to cause chronic granulomatous disease. People with this disorder are at increased risk of developing recurrent episodes of infection and inflammation due to a weakened immune system. Mutations in the CYBA gene cause less than 5 percent of all cases of this condition. Most of these mutations change single building blocks of protein (amino acids) in the cytochrome b-245 alpha chain or cause it to be abnormally short and nonfunctional. An altered protein not only diminishes the function of the alpha chain, but the function of its beta chain partner as well. Without these subunits, NADPH oxidase cannot assemble or function properly. As a result, phagocytes are unable to produce reactive oxygen species to kill foreign invaders, and neutrophil activity is not regulated. A lack of NADPH oxidase leaves affected individuals vulnerable to many types of infection and excessive inflammation.

Mutations in this gene are associated with an autosomal recessive form of a syndrome exhibiting cerebellar ataxia, cognitive disability, and disequilibrium (CAMRQ2). Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2017]From UniProt:Functions as a negative regulator of the PI3 kinase/PI3K activity associated with endosomal membranes via BECN1, a core subunit of the PI3K complex. By modifying the phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate/PtdInsP3 content of endosomal membranes may regulate endosome fusion, recycling, sorting and early to late endosome transport (PubMed:26783301). It is for instance, required for the delivery of cargos like BST2/tetherin from early to late endosome and thereby participates indirectly to their degradation by the lysosome (PubMed:27126989).

            "RAI1\t   The RAI1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is active in cells throughout the body, particularly nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. Located in the nucleus of the cell, the RAI1 protein helps control the activity (expression) of certain genes. Most of the genes regulated by RAI1 have not been identified. However, studies suggest that this protein controls the expression of several genes involved in daily (circadian) rhythms, such as the sleep-wake cycle. The RAI1 protein also appears to play a role in development of the brain and of bones in the head and face (craniofacial bones).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Potocki-Lupski syndrome     Having an extra copy of the RAI1 gene in each cell is thought to underlie many of the major features of Potocki-Lupski syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, mild to moderate intellectual disability, behavioral problems including autism spectrum disorder (which affects social interaction and communication), sleep disturbances, and other health problems. The condition results from abnormal copying (duplication) of a small piece of the short (p) arm of chromosome 17 at position p11.2. In about two-thirds of affected individuals, the duplicated segment includes approximately 3.7 million DNA building blocks (base pairs), also written as 3.7 megabases (Mb). (A deletion of this segment causes Smith-Magenis syndrome, described below.) In the remaining one-third of cases, the duplication is larger or smaller, ranging from less than 1 Mb to almost 20 Mb. All of these duplications affect one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.All of the duplications known to cause Potocki-Lupski syndrome contain the RAI1 gene. Studies suggest that the duplication increases the amount of RAI1 protein, which disrupts the expression of genes that influence circadian rhythms. These changes may account for the sleep disturbances that occur with Potocki-Lupski syndrome. Too much RAI1 protein may also disrupt brain development, which could account for delayed development, intellectual disability, behavioral problems, and other neurological features of this condition. Development of the bones in the head and face may also be affected, leading to subtle facial differences in people with Potocki-Lupski syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Smith-Magenis syndrome     Researchers believe that a partial or total loss of function of the RAI1 gene accounts for most of the signs and symptoms of Smith-Magenis syndrome. The major features of this condition include mild to moderate intellectual disability, delayed speech and language skills, distinctive facial features, sleep disturbances, behavioral problems, and other abnormalities affecting many parts of the body.In most people with Smith-Magenis syndrome, the condition results from a deletion of a small piece of chromosome 17 in each cell. Most often, this chromosome segment, located at 17p11.2, is the same one that is duplicated in Potocki-Lupski syndrome (described above). Occasionally the deletion is larger or smaller. All of the deletions affect one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.All of the deletions known to cause Smith-Magenis syndrome contain the RAI1 gene. Studies suggest that the deletion leads to a reduced amount of RAI1 protein in cells, which disrupts the expression of genes involved in circadian rhythms. These changes may account for the sleep disturbances that occur with Smith-Magenis syndrome. It is unclear how a loss of one copy of the RAI1 gene leads to the other physical, mental, and behavioral problems associated with this condition.A small percentage of people with Smith-Magenis syndrome have a mutation in the RAI1 gene instead of a chromosomal deletion. Although these individuals have many of the major features of the condition, they are less likely than people with a deletion to have certain other features, including short stature, hearing loss, and heart or kidney abnormalities. It is likely that, in people with a deletion, the loss of other genes in the deleted region accounts for these additional signs and symptoms; the role of these genes is under study. More About This Health Condition      Yuan-Harel-Lupski syndrome     Having an extra copy of the RAI1 gene in each cell is thought to underlie many of the major features of Yuan-Harel-Lupski (YUHAL) syndrome, which is characterized by multiple neurological problems. This condition results from duplication of a small piece of chromosome 17 in a region designated p12-p11.2. In YUHAL syndrome, the duplicated segments can range in size from 3.2 Mb to 19.7 Mb. These duplications affect one of the two copies of chromosome 17 in each cell.The duplications that cause YUHAL syndrome all contain the RAI1 gene and a nearby gene called PMP22; the segments may also contain additional genes. Some features of YUHAL syndrome, such as delayed development, behavioral and sleep problems, and unusual facial features, are similar to those of Potocki-Lupski syndrome (described above) and are likely caused by an extra copy of the RAI1 gene. Other features of YUHAL syndrome, such as muscle weakness and decreased sensitivity to touch, heat, and cold in the lower legs and feet, likely result from an extra copy of the PMP22 gene.

            "MAP2K3\t   From NCBI Gene:The protein encoded by this gene is a dual specificity protein kinase that belongs to the MAP kinase kinase family. This kinase is activated by mitogenic and environmental stress, and participates in the MAP kinase-mediated signaling cascade. It phosphorylates and thus activates MAPK14/p38-MAPK. This kinase can be activated by insulin, and is necessary for the expression of glucose transporter. Expression of RAS oncogene is found to result in the accumulation of the active form of this kinase, which thus leads to the constitutive activation of MAPK14, and confers oncogenic transformation of primary cells. The inhibition of this kinase is involved in the pathogenesis of Yersina pseudotuberculosis. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants that encode distinct isoforms have been reported for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Dual specificity kinase. Is activated by cytokines and environmental stress in vivo. Catalyzes the concomitant phosphorylation of a threonine and a tyrosine residue in the MAP kinase p38.

            "SLC46A1\t   The SLC46A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the proton-coupled folate transporter (PCFT). PCFT is important for normal functioning of intestinal epithelial cells, which are cells that line the walls of the intestine. These cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border. PCFT is involved in the process of using energy to move certain B vitamins called folates across the brush border membrane for absorption, a mechanism called active transport. It is also involved in the transport of folates between the brain and the fluid that surrounds it (cerebrospinal fluid). Folates are important for many cell functions, including the production of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Hereditary folate malabsorption     More than 10 mutations in the SLC46A1 gene have been identified in people with hereditary folate malabsorption. These mutations cause the substitution of one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the PCFT protein, or result in a PCFT protein that is shorter than normal. The mutated PCFT protein has little or no activity. In some cases the abnormal protein is not transported to the cell membrane, and so it is unable to perform its function. PCFT inactivity impairs the body's ability to absorb folates from food, leading to the signs and symptoms of hereditary folate malabsorption.

The thermosensitive members of this family are expressed in subsets of sensory neurons that terminate in the skin, and are activated at distinct physiological temperatures. This channel is activated at temperatures between 22 and 40 degrees C. This gene lies in close proximity to another family member gene on chromosome 17, and the two encoded proteins are thought to associate with each other to form heteromeric channels. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene.

This protein has no ligand binding domain of its own and therefore cannot bind growth factors. However, it does bind tightly to other ligand-bound EGF receptor family members to form a heterodimer, stabilizing ligand binding and enhancing kinase-mediated activation of downstream signalling pathways, such as those involving mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase. Allelic variations at amino acid positions 654 and 655 of isoform a (positions 624 and 625 of isoform b) have been reported, with the most common allele, Ile654/Ile655, shown here. Amplification and/or overexpression of this gene has been reported in numerous cancers, including breast and ovarian tumors. Alternative splicing results in several additional transcript variants, some encoding different isoforms and others that have not been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Protein tyrosine kinase that is part of several cell surface receptor complexes, but that apparently needs a coreceptor for ligand binding. Essential component of a neuregulin-receptor complex, although neuregulins do not interact with it alone. GP30 is a potential ligand for this receptor. Regulates outgrowth and stabilization of peripheral microtubules (MTs). Upon ERBB2 activation, the MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway elicits the phosphorylation and thus the inhibition of GSK3B at cell membrane. This prevents the phosphorylation of APC and CLASP2, allowing its association with the cell membrane. In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization.In the nucleus is involved in transcriptional regulation. Associates with the 5'-TCAAATTC-3' sequence in the PTGS2/COX-2 promoter and activates its transcription. Implicated in transcriptional activation of CDKN1A; the function involves STAT3 and SRC.

Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of cells called keratinocytes that make up the skin, hair, and nails. Keratin 10 is produced in keratinocytes in the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis).In the fluid-filled space inside these cells (the cytoplasm), the keratin 10 protein partners with a similar protein, keratin 1 (produced from the KRT1 gene), to form molecules called keratin intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resiliency to the skin and protect it from being damaged by friction and other everyday physical stresses.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Epidermolytic hyperkeratosis     Dozens of mutations in the KRT10 gene have been found in people with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis. This condition is characterized by red, blistering skin at an early age and thick skin (hyperkeratosis) later in life. People with KRT10 gene mutations typically have NPS-type epidermolytic hyperkeratosis, which features thick skin on many parts of the body but not the palms of the hands or soles of the feet.Most KRT10 gene mutations associated with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the keratin 10 protein. These amino acid changes commonly occur in regions of the protein that play a role in intermediate filament formation. The mutations alter the keratin 10 protein and seem to affect how intermediate filaments interact with each other to form networks. The altered proteins still form intermediate filaments, but the intermediate filament networks are disorganized and do not function normally. Without a strong network, skin cells become fragile and are easily damaged, which can lead to blistering in response to friction or mild trauma. It is unclear how these mutations cause the overgrowth of keratinocytes that results in hyperkeratotic skin. More About This Health Condition      Ichthyosis with confetti     Mutations in the KRT10 gene can cause another skin disorder known as ichthyosis with confetti (also called congenital reticular ichthyosiform erythroderma), which is characterized by red, scaly skin all over the body with small patches of normal skin that look like confetti. The patches of normal skin increase in number and size with age. The KRT10 gene mutations involved in this condition, which are initially found in every cell of the body, alter the genetic sequence that is used as a blueprint for protein production, leading to production of abnormal keratin 10 protein. The abnormal protein includes a region at the end with an excess of the amino acid arginine; this arginine-rich region is not found in the normal keratin 10 protein. Researchers believe that this abnormal amino acid sequence directs the protein into the nucleus of the cell, where it cannot form the strong network of intermediate filaments. Loss of this network disrupts the outer layer of skin, contributing to the development of red, scaly skin.In some abnormal cells, the mutated gene corrects itself through a complex process by which genetic material is exchanged between chromosomes. As a result, normal keratin 10 protein is produced and remains in the cytoplasm. The cell becomes normal and, as it continues to grow and divide, forms patches of normal skin in people with ichthyosis with confetti. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Cyclic ichthyosis with epidermolytic hyperkeratosis is another skin disorder caused by mutations in the KRT10 gene.

            "KRT13\t   The KRT13 gene provides instructions for making a protein called keratin 13. Keratins are a group of tough, fibrous proteins that form the structural framework of epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. Keratin 13 is found in the moist lining (mucosae) of the mouth, nose, esophagus, genitals, and anus.Keratin 13 partners with a similar protein, keratin 4 (produced from the KRT4 gene), to form molecules known as intermediate filaments. These filaments assemble into strong networks that provide strength and resilience to the different mucosae. Networks of intermediate filaments protect the mucosae from being damaged by friction or other everyday physical stresses.

These nevi most often occur on the mouth (oral) mucosa (plural: mucosae). Rarely, white sponge nevus occurs on the mucosae of the nose, esophagus, genitals, or anus.The KRT13 gene mutations that cause white sponge nevus disrupt the structure of keratin 13. As a result, keratin 13 does not fit together properly with keratin 4, leading to the formation of irregular intermediate filaments that are easily damaged with little friction or trauma. Fragile intermediate filaments in the oral mucosa might be damaged when eating or brushing one's teeth.

            "JUP\t   The JUP gene provides instructions for making a protein called plakoglobin. This protein is found primarily in cells of the heart and skin, where it is part of two specialized structures called adherens junctions and desmosomes. Both of these structures help hold neighboring cells together, which provides strength and stability to tissues. Desmosomes may also be involved in other critical cell functions, including chemical signaling pathways, the process by which cells mature to perform specific functions (differentiation), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).Studies suggest that plakoglobin also plays a role in signaling within cells as part of the Wnt pathway. Wnt signaling controls the activity of certain genes and regulates the interactions between cells. This signaling pathway is involved in many aspects of development, including the normal development of the heart, skin, and hair.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy     Genetics Home Reference provides information about arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. More About This Health Condition      Keratoderma with woolly hair     Several mutations in the JUP gene have been found to cause a form of keratoderma with woolly hair classified as type I. This form of the condition is also known as Naxos disease. It is characterized by thick, calloused skin on the palms of the hands and soles of the feet (palmoplantar keratoderma); coarse, dry, fine, tightly curled, and sometimes sparse hair; and a potentially life-threatening form of heart disease called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC).The JUP gene mutations that cause keratoderma with woolly hair type I lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the plakoglobin protein. The abnormal plakoglobin does not interact appropriately with other desmosomal proteins, which alters the structure of desmosomes and prevents cells from attaching to one another effectively. Researchers suspect that the impaired connections between cells make the skin, hair, and heart muscle more fragile. Over time, as these tissues are exposed to mechanical stress (for example, friction on the surface of the skin or the constant contraction and relaxation of the heart muscle), they become damaged and can no longer function normally. This mechanism probably underlies the skin, hair, and heart problems that occur in keratoderma with woolly hair type I.Studies suggest that the abnormally short plakoglobin also impairs Wnt signaling, which appears to cause heart muscle cells to be replaced with fat cells over time. This abnormal signaling may influence the development of ARVC in affected individuals. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     JUP gene mutations have also been found to cause a spectrum of signs and symptoms that overlap with those of keratoderma with woolly hair type I (described above). Some affected families have had similar skin and hair abnormalities but no apparent heart problems, while others have had ARVC only, with normal skin and hair. Although these conditions are related to impaired function of plakoglobin and abnormal desmosomes, it is unclear how mutations in this gene lead to these different patterns of features.At least one mutation in the JUP gene can cause a disorder known as lethal congenital epidermolysis bullosa (LCEB). Features of this condition include very fragile skin that blisters and detaches easily, a complete absence of hair (alopecia), and abnormal fingernails. The skin abnormalities lead to a severe loss of fluids and death in early infancy. The mutation found to cause LCEB, written as Gln539Ter or Q539X, prevents the production of any functional plakoglobin. As a result, the skin has no stable desmosomes, so skin cells are unable to attach to one another effectively. Because affected individuals die before heart disease may become apparent, it is unknown whether a complete loss of plakoglobin also impairs desmosomes in the heart.

            "COASY\t   From NCBI Gene:Coenzyme A (CoA) functions as a carrier of acetyl and acyl groups in cells and thus plays an important role in numerous synthetic and degradative metabolic pathways in all organisms. In eukaryotes, CoA and its derivatives are also involved in membrane trafficking and signal transduction. This gene encodes the bifunctional protein coenzyme A synthase (CoAsy) which carries out the last two steps in the biosynthesis of CoA from pantothenic acid (vitamin B5). The phosphopantetheine adenylyltransferase domain of this bifunctional protein catalyzes the conversion of 4'-phosphopantetheine into dephospho-coenzyme A (dpCoA) while its dephospho-CoA kinase domain completes the final step by phosphorylating dpCoA to form CoA. Mutations in this gene are associated with neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA). Alternative splicing results in multiple isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Apr 2014]From UniProt:Bifunctional enzyme that catalyzes the fourth and fifth sequential steps of CoA biosynthetic pathway.

            "BRCA1\t   The BRCA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that acts as a tumor suppressor. Tumor suppressor proteins help prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The BRCA1 protein is involved in repairing damaged DNA. In the nucleus of many types of normal cells, the BRCA1 protein interacts with several other proteins to mend breaks in DNA. These breaks can be caused by natural and medical radiation or other environmental exposures, and they also occur when chromosomes exchange genetic material in preparation for cell division. By helping to repair DNA, the BRCA1 protein plays a critical role in maintaining the stability of a cell's genetic information.Research suggests that the BRCA1 protein also regulates the activity of other genes and plays an essential role in embryonic development. To carry out these functions, the BRCA1 protein interacts with many other proteins, including other tumor suppressors and proteins that regulate cell division.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Breast cancer     Researchers have identified more than 1,800 mutations in the BRCA1 gene. Many of these mutations are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer in both men and women, as well as several other types of cancer. These mutations are present in every cell in the body and can be passed from one generation to the next. As a result, they are associated with cancers that cluster in families. However, not everyone who inherits a mutation in the BRCA1 gene will develop cancer. Other genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also contribute to a person's cancer risk.Most BRCA1 gene mutations lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the BRCA1 protein or prevent any protein from being made from one copy of the gene. As a result, less of this protein is available to help repair damaged DNA or fix mutations that occur in other genes. As these defects accumulate, they can trigger cells to grow and divide uncontrollably to form a tumor. More About This Health Condition      Ovarian cancer     Many of the same BRCA1 gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer (described above) also increase the risk of ovarian cancer. Families with these mutations are often said to be affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome. Women with BRCA1 gene mutations have a 35 to 60 percent chance of developing ovarian cancer in their lifetimes, as compared with 1.6 percent in the general population. More About This Health Condition      Prostate cancer     At least five inherited BRCA1 gene mutations have been found to increase the risk of prostate cancer. These mutations likely reduce the BRCA1 protein's ability to repair DNA, allowing potentially damaging mutations to persist in various other genes. The accumulation of damaging mutations can lead to the out-of-control cell growth and division that can cause a tumor to develop. Men who carry a BRCA1 gene mutation that increases the risk of prostate cancer may also be at increased risk for other cancers. More About This Health Condition      Other cancers     Inherited mutations in the BRCA1 gene also increase the risk of several other types of cancer, including pancreatic cancer and colon cancer. These mutations impair the ability of the BRCA1 protein to help repair damaged DNA. As defects accumulate in DNA, they can trigger cells to grow and divide without order to form a tumor. It is not clear why different individuals with BRCA1 mutations develop cancers in different organs.

            "WNT3\t   The WNT3 gene is part of a large family of WNT genes, which play critical roles in development before birth.  WNT genes provide instructions for making proteins that participate in chemical signaling pathways in the body.  These pathways control the activity of certain genes and regulate the interactions between cells during embryonic development.Research in animals indicates that the protein produced from the WNT3 gene is critical for the outgrowth of the limbs in the developing embryo.  The WNT3 protein also appears to play an important role in determining the anterior-posterior axis (the imaginary line that runs from head to tail in animals) during the earliest stages of embryonic development.  Additionally, the effects of mutations in the human WNT3 gene suggest that the protein may be involved in the normal formation of the facial features, head, heart, lungs, nervous system, skeleton, and genitalia.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Tetra-amelia syndrome     A mutation in the WNT3 gene has been shown to cause tetra-amelia syndrome among members of one large family from Turkey.  This mutation, which occurs in both copies of the WNT3 gene in each cell, replaces one protein building block (amino acid) with a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the WNT3 protein.  This mutation is written as Gln83Ter or Q83X.Researchers believe that the Gln83Ter mutation results in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the WNT3 protein.  Loss of the WNT3 protein disrupts normal limb formation before birth and leads to the other serious birth defects associated with tetra-amelia syndrome.

            "GP1BA\t   The GP1BA gene provides instructions for making a protein called glycoprotein Ib-alpha (GPIbα). This protein is one piece (subunit) of a protein complex called GPIb-IX-V, which plays a role in blood clotting. GPIb-IX-V is found on the surface of small cell fragments called platelets, which circulate in blood and are an essential component of blood clots. The complex can attach (bind) to a protein called von Willebrand factor, fitting together like a lock and its key. Von Willebrand factor is found on the inside surface of blood vessels, particularly when there is an injury. Binding of the GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand factor allows platelets to stick to the blood vessel wall at the site of the injury. These platelets form clots, plugging holes in the blood vessels to help stop bleeding.To form the GPIb-IX-V complex, GPIbα interacts with other protein subunits called GPIb-beta, GPIX, and GPV, each of which is produced from a different gene. GPIbα is essential for assembly of the complex at the platelet surface. It is the piece of the complex that interacts with von Willebrand factor to trigger blood clotting. GPIbα also interacts with other blood clotting proteins to aid in other steps of the clotting process.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Bernard-Soulier syndrome     At least 54 GP1BA gene mutations have been found to cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a condition characterized by a reduced number of platelets that are larger than normal (macrothrombocytopenia) and excessive bleeding. Some of these mutations lead to production of an altered GPIbα subunit that is likely broken down too soon or that cannot get to the platelet surface. Lack of this subunit on the surface of platelets prevents formation of the GPIb-IX-V complex. Without GPIb-IX-V, platelets cannot come together at the site of an injury to form a clot, leading to the bleeding problems associated with Bernard-Soulier syndrome. Other mutations lead to production of a subunit that can form GPIb-IX-V complexes but cannot interact with von Willebrand factor, which also impairs the accumulation of platelets necessary for clotting. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     At least six mutations in the GP1BA gene can cause another bleeding disorder called platelet-type von Willebrand disease (also known as pseudo-von Willebrand disease). This disorder is characterized by a reduced number of platelets in the blood (thrombocytopenia) and mild bleeding abnormalities. In contrast to mutations that cause Bernard-Soulier syndrome (described above), mutations involved in platelet-type von Willebrand disease lead to excessive binding of the GPIb-IX-V complex to von Willebrand factor. Because platelets containing the altered complex attach to von Willebrand factor without an injury to the blood vessel, fewer platelets are available for clot formation when an injury occurs, which leads to excessive bleeding in people with platelet-type von Willebrand disease.

            "NLRP1\t   The NLRP1 gene provides instructions for making a member of a family of proteins called nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat containing (NLR) proteins. These proteins are involved in the immune system, helping to regulate the process of inflammation. Inflammation occurs when the immune system sends signaling molecules and white blood cells to a site of injury or disease to fight microbial invaders and facilitate tissue repair. The body then stops (inhibits) the inflammatory response to prevent damage to its own cells and tissues.The NLRP1 protein is involved in the assembly of a molecular complex called an inflammasome, which helps trigger the inflammatory process in response to the presence of bacteria or viruses. Researchers believe that the NLRP1 protein may also play a role in the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Vitiligo     Studies have associated variations in the NLRP1 gene with an increased risk of vitiligo, an autoimmune condition that results in patchy changes in skin coloring (pigmentation).One of the NLRP1 gene variations associated with vitiligo changes the protein building block (amino acid) leucine to the amino acid histidine at position 155 in the NLRP1 protein sequence, written as Leu155His or L155H. This and other variations likely affect the activity of the NLRP1 protein, making it more difficult for the body to control inflammation and prevent the immune system from attacking its own tissues. While the pigment loss associated with vitiligo results from the immune system attacking pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the skin, it is unclear what specific circumstances trigger the immune system to do so. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified. More About This Health Condition      Autoimmune Addison disease     Genetics Home Reference provides information about autoimmune Addison disease. More About This Health Condition      Autoimmune disorders     NLRP1 gene variations have been associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. These disorders include type 1 diabetes, in which insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed, and Addison disease, which is caused by autoimmune damage to the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands). Certain NLRP1 gene variations seem to make affected individuals more prone to overactivity of the immune system, resulting in damage to the body's own tissues and organs.

While the pigment loss associated with vitiligo results from the immune system attacking pigment-producing cells (melanocytes) in the skin, it is unclear what specific circumstances trigger the immune system to do so. The condition probably results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors, most of which have not been identified. More About This Health Condition  Genetics Home Reference provides information about autoimmune Addison disease. More About This Health Condition  NLRP1 gene variations have been associated with an increased risk of autoimmune disorders. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. These disorders include type 1 diabetes, in which insulin-producing cells in the pancreas are destroyed, and Addison disease, which is caused by autoimmune damage to the small hormone-producing glands on top of each kidney (adrenal glands). Certain NLRP1 gene variations seem to make affected individuals more prone to overactivity of the immune system, resulting in damage to the body's own tissues and organs.

The complex functions in spliceosomal snRNP assembly in the cytoplasm, and regenerates spliceosomes required for pre-mRNA splicing in the nucleus. The encoded protein directly interacts with a DEAD box protein and several spliceosome core proteins. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described, but their biological validity has not been determined. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:The SMN complex plays a catalyst role in the assembly of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (snRNPs), the building blocks of the spliceosome. Thereby, plays an important role in the splicing of cellular pre-mRNAs. Most spliceosomal snRNPs contain a common set of Sm proteins SNRPB, SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPD3, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG that assemble in a heptameric protein ring on the Sm site of the small nuclear RNA to form the core snRNP. In the cytosol, the Sm proteins SNRPD1, SNRPD2, SNRPE, SNRPF and SNRPG are trapped in an inactive 6S pICln-Sm complex by the chaperone CLNS1A that controls the assembly of the core snRNP. Dissociation by the SMN complex of CLNS1A from the trapped Sm proteins and their transfer to an SMN-Sm complex triggers the assembly of core snRNPs and their transport to the nucleus.

            "TSEN54\t   The TSEN54 gene provides instructions for making one part (subunit) of an enzyme called the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex. This complex helps process several types of RNA molecules, which are chemical cousins of DNA.The tRNA splicing endonuclease complex is particularly important for the normal processing of a form of RNA known as transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNA molecules help assemble protein building blocks called amino acids into full-length proteins. However, before they can assemble proteins, tRNAs must be processed into mature molecules. In particular, regions called introns need to be removed from some tRNAs for the molecules to be functional. The tRNA splicing endonuclease complex recognizes and then removes introns to help produce mature tRNA molecules.Studies suggest that the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex may also be involved in processing another form of RNA known as messenger RNA (mRNA). mRNA serves as a genetic blueprint for making proteins. Researchers suspect that the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex cuts (cleaves) one end of mRNA molecules so a string of adenines (one of the building blocks of RNA) can be added. This process is known as polyadenylation, and the string of adenines is known as a poly(A) tail. The poly(A) tail signals the stopping point for protein production and protects mRNA from being broken down before protein production occurs.

TSEN54 gene mutations are the most frequent cause of a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 2 (PCH2). When PCH2 results from TSEN54 gene mutations, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH2A. Mutations in the TSEN54 gene also cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 4 (PCH4) and appear to be a rare cause of pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1).The most common mutation in the TSEN54 gene replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid serine at position 307 in the TSEN54 protein (written as Ala307Ser or A307S). About 90 percent of all people with PCH2 have this mutation in both copies of the TSEN54 gene in each cell. At least one person diagnosed with PCH1 also had the mutation in both copies of the gene. Most individuals with PCH4 have the common Ala307Ser mutation in one copy of the TSEN54 gene in each cell and a different mutation in the other copy of the gene.The TSEN54 gene mutations that cause pontocerebellar hypoplasia impair the function of the tRNA splicing endonuclease complex, which likely disrupts the processing of RNA molecules and affects the production of many types of proteins.

The α6β4 integrin protein plays a particularly important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. It is a component of hemidesmosomes, which are microscopic structures that anchor the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers. As part of a complex network of proteins in hemidesmosomes, α6β4 integrin helps to hold the layers of skin together.

In addition to skin blistering, people with EB-PA are born with a life-threatening obstruction of the digestive tract called pyloric atresia. Mutations in the ITGB4 gene account for about 80 percent of all cases of EB-PA.ITGB4 gene mutations alter the normal structure and function of the β4 integrin subunit or prevent cells from producing enough of this subunit. As a result, α6β4 integrin is defective or missing. Mutations that lead to a complete or near-complete loss of α6β4 integrin tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms of EB-PA, while mutations that alter the structure or stability of this protein usually cause milder signs and symptoms. A shortage of functional α6β4 integrin causes cells in the epidermis to be fragile and easily damaged. Friction or other minor trauma can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the widespread formation of blisters. It is less clear how mutations in the ITGB4 gene are related to pyloric atresia. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     Researchers believe that α6β4 integrin may play a critical role in the progression of cancerous tumors called carcinomas. These cancers arise in epithelial cells and can affect many tissues and organs, including the breast, lung, liver, colon, and skin.Changes in the location and activity of α6β4 integrin within cancer cells are associated with the progression of carcinomas. The integrin protein activates key signaling molecules, which trigger cancer cells to migrate through the body and invade other tissues. These signals also make cancer cells more resistant to self-destruction (apoptosis).Recent studies suggest that, in addition to its role in the progression of existing carcinomas, α6β4 integrin may be involved in the initial formation of these tumors.

            "RNF213\t   The RNF213 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose role is unknown. The RNF213 protein, which is found in tissues throughout the body, contains specific regions (domains) that hint at possible functions. One domain, known as a RING finger, is found in proteins that have an enzyme activity known as E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. Proteins with this activity target other proteins to be broken down (degraded) within cells. Protein degradation is a normal process that removes damaged or unnecessary proteins and helps maintain the normal functions of cells. Proteins with a RING finger domain are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell growth and division, the transmission of chemical signals (signal transduction), and the self-destruction of cells (apoptosis).The RNF213 protein also contains two regions called AAA+ ATPase domains. Proteins with these domains typically regulate mechanical processes in the cell, such as protein unfolding, DNA unwinding, or transporting molecules.Although the function of the RNF213 protein is unknown, studies suggest that it plays a role in the proper development of blood vessels.

More About This Health Condition      Moyamoya disease     At least 24 genetic changes in the RNF213 gene have been associated with moyamoya disease. This condition is characterized by narrowing of blood vessels in the brain and subsequent growth of networks of small, fragile blood vessels. The resulting lack of blood flow in the brain leads to strokes and other features of the condition.Changes in the RNF213 gene involved in moyamoya disease replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the RNF213 protein. The most common change is a normal variation (polymorphism) of the gene that replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid lysine at protein position 4810 (written as Arg4810Lys or R4810K). This genetic change is found in a majority of affected individuals in Asian populations and is relatively common in unaffected individuals in these populations, occurring in about 1 percent. (This phenomenon, in which people with an altered copy of the gene never develop the condition, is known as reduced penetrance.) However, the Arg4810Lys change is not found in affected individuals of European descent. These individuals have rarer RNF213 gene mutations that change single amino acids in the protein.Little is known about the effect of these changes on the function of the RNF213 protein, and researchers are unsure how the changes contribute to the characteristic blood vessel abnormalities of moyamoya disease. It is unclear if RNF213 gene mutations are involved in the narrowing of blood vessels in the brain. For unknown reasons, people with moyamoya disease have elevated levels of proteins involved in cell and tissue growth, including the growth of blood vessels (angiogenesis). An excess of these proteins could account for the growth of new blood vessels characteristic of moyamoya disease. It is not clear if changes in the RNF213 gene are involved in the overproduction of these proteins.Little is known about the cause of moyamoya disease. Studies suggest that other genes could be involved in development of the condition. It has been suggested that other factors, such as infection or inflammation, in combination with genetic changes may be necessary for development of moyamoya disease.

            "MOCOS\t   The MOCOS gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called molybdenum cofactor sulfurase. This enzyme is necessary for the function of two other enzymes, xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase. Xanthine dehydrogenase is involved in the normal breakdown of purines, which are building blocks of DNA and its chemical cousin, RNA. Specifically, it carries out the final two steps in the process: the conversion of a molecule called hypoxanthine to another molecule called xanthine, and the conversion of xanthine to uric acid, a waste product that is normally excreted in urine and feces. Less is known about the function of aldehyde oxidase, although it appears to play a role in the breakdown (metabolism) of many different compounds.Molybdenum cofactor sulfurase carries out a chemical reaction that adds sulfur to a molecule called the molybdenum cofactor. This molecule is required for xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase to be turned on (activated) and carry out their functions.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Hereditary xanthinuria     At least four mutations in the MOCOS gene have been found to cause hereditary xanthinuria type II, a condition that most often affects the kidneys. Most of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in molybdenum cofactor sulfurase. The effects of these mutations are not fully understood, but they likely alter the shape and function of the enzyme. If molybdenum cofactor sulfurase is unable to add sulfur to the molybdenum cofactor, xanthine dehydrogenase and aldehyde oxidase are not activated. The loss of aldehyde oxidase activity does not appear to cause any signs or symptoms. However, the loss of xanthine dehydrogenase activity prevents the conversion of xanthine to uric acid, leading to an accumulation of xanthine in the kidneys and other tissues. The excess xanthine can form tiny crystals that accumulate in the kidneys, occasionally leading to the formation of stones that can impair kidney function and ultimately cause kidney failure. Less commonly, xanthine crystals build up in the muscles, causing pain and cramping. In some people with hereditary xanthinuria type II, the condition does not cause any health problems.

            "TGIF1\t   The TGIF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called TG-interacting factor. This protein is important for normal development of the front part of the brain (forebrain). TG-interacting factor is a transcription factor, which means that it regulates the activity of certain genes. This protein turns off genes by attaching (binding) to specific regions of DNA or by interacting with other DNA-binding proteins.TG-interacting factor regulates signaling pathways that are important for embryonic development. This protein blocks the signals of the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-β) pathway. This signaling pathway transmits chemical signals from the cell surface to the nucleus, which allows the environment outside the cell to affect how the cell produces other proteins. TG-interacting factor also blocks a molecule called retinoic acid from regulating gene activity. Retinoic acid, a form of vitamin A, binds to a group of transcription factors that regulate a number of genes important for early development. By blocking these signaling pathways, TG-interacting factor ensures that certain genes are turned off at the proper time.

This condition occurs when the brain fails to divide into two halves (hemispheres) during early development. TGIF1 gene mutations are the fourth most common cause of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. These mutations disrupt the protein's ability to bind with DNA or interact with other proteins. As a result, TG-interacting factor cannot block the signals of the TGF-β pathway and retinoic acid. If the signals involved in forebrain development are not properly regulated, the brain does not separate into two hemispheres.

            "EPG5\t   The EPG5 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in a cellular process called autophagy. This process recycles worn-out or unnecessary cell parts and breaks down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. Autophagy also helps cells use materials most efficiently when energy demands are high. During autophagy, materials to be recycled or removed are isolated in compartments called autophagosomes. The autophagosomes are then transported to cell structures called lysosomes that break down the materials. The EPG5 protein is important for the interaction between autophagosomes and lysosomes that allows the transfer of materials.In addition to its role in autophagy, the EPG5 protein aids in the cell's ability to recognize infection from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. The protein transports molecules from these invaders within cells so they can interact with immune system proteins that trigger reactions to fight the infection.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Vici syndrome     At least 60 mutations in the EPG5 gene have been found to cause Vici syndrome, a severe condition that primarily affects the brain, immune system, heart, skin, and eyes. Most of these mutations lead to an abnormally short EPG5 protein that does not function. Without EPG5 protein activity, foreign invaders cannot trigger immune reactions, which leads to recurrent infections. In addition, autophagy is impaired. Researchers speculate that problems with autophagy disrupt the normal development and survival of cells in the brain and other organs and tissues that require large amounts of energy; however, they do not fully understand how the impairment leads to signs and symptoms of Vici syndrome.

            "TNFRSF11A\t   The TNFRSF11A gene provides instructions for making a protein called receptor activator of NF-κB (RANK). This protein plays an important role in bone remodeling, a normal process in which old bone is broken down and new bone is created to replace it. During bone remodeling, RANK helps direct the formation and function of specialized cells called osteoclasts, which break down bone tissue.  RANK is located on the surface of immature osteoclasts, where it receives signals that trigger these cells to mature and become fully functional.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Osteopetrosis     Genetics Home Reference provides information about osteopetrosis. More About This Health Condition      Paget disease of bone     At least two very similar mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene have been found to cause the rare, early-onset form of Paget disease of bone. Both mutations are duplications, which means that they abnormally copy a segment of genetic material within the gene. Each of these mutations results in the production of a RANK protein that contains several extra protein building blocks (amino acids).Through a mechanism that is not well understood, duplication mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene appear to overactivate the chemical signaling pathway that promotes osteoclast formation. The increased signaling stimulates the production of too many osteoclasts and triggers these cells to break down bone abnormally. In people with early-onset Paget disease of bone, affected bone is broken down and replaced much faster than usual. When the new bone tissue grows, it is weaker and less organized than normal bone. These problems with bone remodeling cause certain bones to become unusually large, misshapen, and easily broken (fractured). More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene are responsible for several other rare bone diseases, including two very similar disorders called familial expansile osteolysis (FEO) and expansile skeletal hyperphosphatasia (ESH). These disorders have signs and symptoms that overlap with those of early-onset Paget disease of bone. In fact, some researchers believe that FEO, ESH, and early-onset Paget disease of bone actually may be slightly different forms of a single condition. FEO and ESH both appear early in life and are characterized by skeletal abnormalities, tooth loss, and progressive hearing loss.Like early-onset Paget disease of bone, FEO and ESH result from duplication mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene. Studies suggest that these mutations overactivate RANK, leading it to stimulate the production of too many osteoclasts and trigger these cells to break down bone abnormally. The resulting imbalance in bone remodeling causes the major features of these disorders. It is unclear why duplication mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene can cause several different bone diseases.TNFRSF11A gene mutations also cause a bone disease called autosomal recessive osteopetrosis (ARO). This disorder appears in infancy and is characterized by abnormally dense bones. The increased bone density leads to a variety of complications, including an increased risk of fractures, vision impairment, hearing loss, and problems with the immune system related to defective bone marrow. Mutations in the TNFRSF11A gene appear to be a very rare cause of ARO; fewer than 10 mutations have been found in affected individuals. Most of these mutations change single amino acids in the RANK protein, which prevents it from receiving signals on the surface of immature osteoclasts. As a result, people with this condition have a total absence of mature, functional osteoclasts. Without these specialized cells to break down bone tissue, excess bone is formed throughout the skeleton.

            "DOCK6\t   The DOCK6 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GEFs turn on (activate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Often referred to as molecular switches, GTPases can be turned on and off. GTPases are turned off (inactivated) when they are attached (bound) to a molecule called GDP and are activated when they are bound to another molecule called GTP. The DOCK6 protein activates GTPases known as Cdc42 and Rac1 by exchanging GTP for the attached GDP. Once Cdc42 and Rac1 are active, they transmit signals that are critical for various aspects of embryonic development. The DOCK6 protein appears to regulate these GTPases specifically during development of the limbs, skull, and heart. DOCK6 also plays a role in the development of fibers (axons) that extend from nerve cells.

Neurological abnormalities, such as brain or eye malformations and intellectual disability, are more common in DOCK6-related Adams-Oliver syndrome than in cases associated with other genes. Most DOCK6 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of an abnormally short DOCK6 protein that is likely unable to function. Other mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the DOCK6 protein, which impairs the protein's normal function.

            "ACP5\t   The ACP5 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase type 5 (TRAP). The TRAP enzyme primarily regulates the activity of a protein called osteopontin, which is produced in bone cells called osteoclasts and in immune cells. Osteopontin performs a variety of functions in these cells. Two versions (isoforms) of the TRAP enzyme are produced: TRAP5a is found primarily in immune cells and TRAP5b is found primarily in bone cells called osteoclasts.Osteoclasts are specialized cells that break down and remove (resorb) bone tissue that is no longer needed. These cells are involved in bone remodeling, which is a normal process that replaces old bone tissue with new bone. During bone remodeling, osteopontin is turned on (activated), allowing osteoclasts to attach (bind) to bones. When the breakdown of bone is complete, TRAP5b turns off (inactivates) osteopontin, causing the osteoclasts to release themselves from bone.In the immune system, osteopontin is found primarily in cells called macrophages and dendritic cells. The protein helps fight infection by promoting inflammation, regulating immune cell activity, and turning on various immune system cells that are necessary to fight off foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Like TRAP5b in bone cells, the TRAP5a enzyme inactivates osteopontin in macrophages and dendritic cells when it is no longer needed.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation     At least 10 mutations in the ACP5 gene have been found to cause spondyloenchondrodysplasia with immune dysregulation (SPENCDI). This condition is characterized by abnormalities in bone growth and immune system function. The ACP5 gene mutations that cause SPENCDI typically change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the TRAP enzyme or result in the production of an abnormally short enzyme. These mutations affect both TRAP isoforms and impair or eliminate TRAP's ability to inactivate osteopontin. As a result, osteopontin is abnormally active, prolonging bone breakdown by osteoclasts and triggering abnormal inflammation and immune responses by immune cells.In people with SPENCDI, increased bone breakdown contributes to the skeletal abnormalities, including irregularly shaped bones and short stature. An overactive immune system leads to increased susceptibility to autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. Immune system abnormalities also impair the body's normal response to harmful invaders, resulting in frequent infections. SPENCDI has several additional features, including movement disorders and intellectual disability, but it is unknown how changes in TRAP enzyme function lead to these other signs and symptoms.

Somatic mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. They do not occur as part of a cancer syndrome. Somatic STK11 gene mutations have been identified in a form of lung cancer called non-small cell lung carcinoma, cervical cancer, colorectal cancer, an aggressive type of skin cancer called melanoma, and pancreatic cancer. These mutations impair the function of serine/threonine kinase 11, which can allow cells to grow and divide uncontrollably and contribute to the formation of a cancerous tumor.

            "CACNA1A\t   The CACNA1A gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (calcium ions) across cell membranes, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Calcium ions are involved in many different cellular functions, including cell-to-cell communication, the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction), and the regulation of certain genes.The CACNA1A gene provides instructions for making one part (the alpha-1 subunit) of a calcium channel called CaV2.1. This subunit forms the hole (pore) through which calcium ions can flow. CaV2.1 channels play an essential role in communication between nerve cells (neurons) in the brain. These channels help control the release of neurotransmitters, which are chemicals that relay signals from one neuron to another. Researchers believe that CaV2.1 channels are also involved in the survival of neurons and the ability of these cells to change and adapt over time (plasticity).Near one end of the CACNA1A gene, a segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) is repeated multiple times. This sequence, which is written as CAG, is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in this gene ranges from 4 to 18.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Episodic ataxia     More than 80 mutations in the CACNA1A gene have been found to cause episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2), the most common form of episodic ataxia. In addition to problems with coordination and balance (ataxia), EA2 is associated with involuntary eye movements called nystagmus. The CACNA1A mutations responsible for EA2 reduce the production of functional CaV2.1 channels or prevent these channels from reaching the cell membrane, where they are needed to transport calcium ions. A decrease in the number of these channels reduces the total flow of calcium ions into neurons, which disrupts the release of neurotransmitters in the brain. Although changes in signaling between neurons underlie the episodes of uncoordinated movement seen in people with episodic ataxia, it is unclear how altered calcium ion transport causes the specific features of the condition. More About This Health Condition      Familial hemiplegic migraine     At least 20 mutations in the CACNA1A gene have been identified in people with familial hemiplegic migraine type 1 (FHM1). This condition is characterized by migraine headaches with a pattern of neurological symptoms known as aura. In FHM1, the aura includes temporary numbness or weakness on one side of the body (hemiparesis). Like EA2 (described above), FHM1 is commonly associated with ataxia and nystagmus. Most of the mutations that cause FHM1 change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the CaV2.1 channel. The most common mutation, which has been found in more than a dozen affected families, replaces the amino acid threonine with the amino acid methionine at protein position 666 (written as Thr666Met or T666M).The CACNA1A mutations responsible for familial hemiplegic migraine change the structure of the CaV2.1 channel. The altered channels open more easily than usual, which increases the inward flow of calcium ions. A greater influx of calcium ions through CaV2.1 channels increases the cell's release of neurotransmitters. The resulting changes in signaling between neurons lead to development of these severe headaches in people with familial hemiplegic migraine. More About This Health Condition      Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6     Spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA6) is another disorder caused by CACNA1A gene mutations. The major features of this condition include progressive ataxia, nystagmus, and impaired speech (dysarthria), most often beginning in a person's forties or fifties. SCA6 results from an increased number of copies (expansion) of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the CACNA1A gene. In people with this condition, the CAG segment is repeated from 20 to more than 30 times.An increase in the length of the CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the alpha-1 subunit. The abnormal subunit is found in the cell membrane as well as in the fluid inside cells (cytoplasm), where it forms clumps (aggregates). The effect these aggregates have on cell functioning is unknown. The lack of normal calcium channels impairs the cells' ability to transport calcium ions. These changes alter the release of neurotransmitters in the brain and eventually lead to the death of neurons. Certain neurons called Purkinje cells seem to be particularly sensitive to a disruption in calcium transport. Purkinje cells are located in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum). Over time, the loss of Purkinje cells and other cells of the cerebellum causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA6. More About This Health Condition      Sporadic hemiplegic migraine     At least nine mutations in the CACNA1A gene have been found to cause sporadic hemiplegic migraine. The signs and symptoms of this condition are identical to those of FHM1 (described above); however, sporadic hemiplegic migraine occurs in people with no family history of the condition. As in FHM1, sporadic hemiplegic migraine caused by CACNA1A gene mutations is commonly associated with ataxia and nystagmus in addition to migraine headaches and auras.CACNA1A gene mutations that cause sporadic hemiplegic migraine change single amino acids in the CaV2.1 channel. Many of these mutations are also found in families with FHM1. The altered channels are more active than usual, which increases the release of neurotransmitters. The abnormal signaling between neurons caused by these changes lead to the headaches and auras characteristic of sporadic hemiplegic migraine. More About This Health Condition      19p13.13 deletion syndrome     The CACNA1A gene is located in a region of chromosome 19 that is missing in most people with 19p13.13 deletion syndrome. As a result of this deletion, many affected individuals are missing one copy of CACNA1A and several other genes in each cell. Features associated with 19p13.13 deletion syndrome include an unusually large head size (macrocephaly), tall stature, intellectual disability, seizures, ataxia, and other health problems. Researchers are working to determine which missing genes contribute to the specific features of the disorder. Studies suggest that the loss of one copy of the CACNA1A gene may underlie the seizures and ataxia in affected individuals. The deletion reduces the amount of CaV2.1 channels produced within cells, although it is unclear exactly how a shortage of these channels is related to seizures and ataxia in people with 19p13.13 deletion syndrome.

Ligands of this family bind various TGF-beta receptors leading to recruitment and activation of SMAD family transcription factors that regulate gene expression. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed to generate each subunit of the disulfide-linked homodimer. Studies in rodents suggest that this protein is involved in the establishment of left-right asymmetry in early embryogenesis and in neural development in later embryogenesis. The encoded protein is translated from a bicistronic mRNA that also encodes ceramide synthase 1. Mutations in this gene are associated with several congenital cardiovascular malformations.

            "RGS9BP\t   The RGS9BP gene (which is also known as R9AP) provides instructions for making a protein called RGS9 binding protein. This protein is found in the retina, which is the specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color. Within the retina, the protein is associated with light-detecting cells called photoreceptors. As its name suggests, RGS9 binding protein interacts with a protein called RGS9 (which is produced from the RGS9 gene). It anchors the RGS9 protein to photoreceptors and stimulates RGS9's activity.When light enters the eye, it stimulates specialized pigments in photoreceptor cells. This stimulation triggers a series of chemical reactions that produce an electrical signal, which is interpreted by the brain as vision. (This process is known as phototransduction.) Once photoreceptors have been stimulated by light, they must return to their resting state before they can be stimulated again. RGS9 and RGS9 binding protein are involved in a chemical reaction that helps return photoreceptors to their resting state quickly after light exposure.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Bradyopsia     At least six mutations in the RGS9BP gene have been found to cause bradyopsia, a rare condition that affects vision. In people with bradyopsia, the eyes adapt more slowly than usual to changing light conditions (for example, walking out of a darkened movie theater into daylight or driving into a dark tunnel on a sunny day). Some affected individuals also have difficulty seeing small moving objects, such as a tennis ball.The RGS9BP gene mutations that cause bradyopsia prevent RGS9 binding protein from anchoring the RGS9 protein to photoreceptor cells. The resulting loss of RGS9 protein function prevents photoreceptors from recovering quickly after responding to light. Normally they return to their resting state in a fraction of a second, but in people with RGS9BP gene mutations, it can take ten seconds or longer. During that time, the photoreceptors cannot respond to light. This delay causes temporary blindness in response to changing light conditions and may interfere with seeing small objects when they are in motion.

            "NPHS1\t   The NPHS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called nephrin. Nephrin is primarily found in the kidneys, which are organs that filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. Specifically, nephrin is found in cells called podocytes, which are located in specialized kidney structures called glomeruli. Nephrin is located at the cell surface in the area between two podocytes called the slit diaphragm. The slit diaphragm is known as a filtration barrier because it captures proteins in blood so that they remain in the body while allowing other molecules like sugars and salts to be excreted in urine. Nephrin proteins on one cell interact with nephrin proteins on adjacent podocytes, forming a zipper-like structure. This structure allows the passage of small molecules through the slit diaphragm while preventing larger molecules like proteins from passing through. Nephrin proteins are essential for forming the slit diaphragm, anchoring the slit diaphragm to podocytes, and filtering blood.Nephrin is also involved in cell signaling. It relays signals from outside the cell to inside the cell. Additionally, nephrin proteins on the surface of adjacent cells send and receive signals, allowing podocytes to communicate with one another.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Congenital nephrotic syndrome     At least 250 mutations in the NPHS1 gene have been found to cause congenital nephrotic syndrome. This condition is a kidney disorder that begins in infancy and typically leads to irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease) by early childhood.NPHS1 gene mutations account for all cases of congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type. This form of the condition is found in people of Finnish ancestry. Two specific mutations, both of which result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional nephrin protein, account for nearly all cases. The first mutation, known as Finnmajor, is written as L41fsX90 and is responsible for 78 percent of cases. The second mutation, known as Finnminor, is written as R1109X and is responsible for 16 percent of cases.NPHS1 gene mutations can also cause congenital nephrotic syndrome in non-Finnish individuals. Most of these mutations result in an abnormal nephrin protein that is trapped inside the cell and cannot get to the podocyte cell surface. A shortage of functional nephrin at the podocyte cell surface impairs the formation of normal slit diaphragms. Without a functional slit diaphragm, molecules pass through the kidneys abnormally and are excreted in urine. The filtering ability of the kidneys worsens from birth, eventually leading to end-stage renal disease.

            "PRX\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a protein involved in peripheral nerve myelin upkeep. The encoded protein contains 2 PDZ domains which were named after PSD95 (post synaptic density protein), DlgA (Drosophila disc large tumor suppressor), and ZO1 (a mammalian tight junction protein). Two alternatively spliced transcript variants have been described for this gene which encode different protein isoforms and which are targeted differently in the Schwann cell. Mutations in this gene cause Charcot-Marie-Tooth neuoropathy, type 4F and Dejerine-Sottas neuropathy.

[MIM:145900]Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease 4F (CMT4F): A recessive demyelinating form of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, a disorder of the peripheral nervous system, characterized by progressive weakness and atrophy, initially of the peroneal muscles and later of the distal muscles of the arms. Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is classified in two main groups on the basis of electrophysiologic properties and histopathology: primary peripheral demyelinating neuropathies (designated CMT1 when they are dominantly inherited) and primary peripheral axonal neuropathies (CMT2). Demyelinating neuropathies are characterized by severely reduced nerve conduction velocities (less than 38 m/sec), segmental demyelination and remyelination with onion bulb formations on nerve biopsy, slowly progressive distal muscle atrophy and weakness, absent deep tendon reflexes, and hollow feet. By convention autosomal recessive forms of demyelinating Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease are designated CMT4. CMT4F is characterized by distal sensory impairment and distal muscle weakness and atrophy affecting the lower more than the upper limbs. The age at onset is variable and can range from childhood to adult years. When the onset is in infancy, the phenotype is characterized as Dejerine-Sottas syndrome.

            "BCKDHA\t   The BCKDHA gene provides instructions for making one part, the alpha subunit, of a group of enzymes called the branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase (BCKD) enzyme complex. Two alpha subunits connect with two beta subunits, which are produced from the BCKDHB gene, to form a critical piece of the enzyme complex called the E1 component.The BCKD enzyme complex is responsible for one step in the normal breakdown of three protein building blocks (amino acids). These amino acids—leucine, isoleucine, and valine—are obtained from the diet. They are present in many kinds of food, particularly protein-rich foods such as milk, meat, and eggs. The BCKD enzyme complex is active in mitochondria, which are specialized structures inside cells that serve as energy-producing centers. The breakdown of leucine, isoleucine, and valine produces molecules that can be used for energy.

These mutations most often cause the severe, classic form of the disorder, which becomes apparent soon after birth. Maple syrup urine disease gets its name from the distinctive sweet odor of affected infants' urine. It is also characterized by poor feeding, vomiting, lack of energy (lethargy), abnormal movements, and delayed development.Most BCKDHA mutations change single amino acids in the alpha subunit of the BCKD enzyme complex. In the Old Order Mennonite population, where maple syrup urine disease occurs frequently, the most common mutation replaces the amino acid tyrosine with the amino acid asparagine at position 438 (written as Tyr438Asn or Y438N).Mutations in the BCKDHA gene disrupt the normal function of the BCKD enzyme complex, preventing it from effectively breaking down leucine, isoleucine, and valine. As a result, these amino acids and their byproducts build up in the body. This accumulation is toxic to cells and tissues, particularly in the nervous system. The buildup of these substances can lead to seizures, developmental delay, and the other health problems associated with maple syrup urine disease.

            "DMPK\t   The DMPK gene provides instructions for making a protein called myotonic dystrophy protein kinase. Although the specific function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in muscle, heart, and brain cells. This protein may be involved in communication within cells. It also appears to regulate the production and function of important structures inside muscle cells by interacting with other proteins. For example, myotonic dystrophy protein kinase has been shown to turn off (inhibit) part of a muscle protein called myosin phosphatase. Myosin phosphatase is an enzyme that plays a role in muscle tensing (contraction) and relaxation.One region of the DMPK gene contains a segment of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that is repeated multiple times. This sequence, which is written as CTG, is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CTG repeats in this gene ranges from 5 to 34.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Myotonic dystrophy     Type 1 myotonic dystrophy results from a mutation in the DMPK gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the size of the repeated CTG segment in the DMPK gene. People with type 1 myotonic dystrophy have from 50 to 5,000 CTG repeats in most cells. The number of repeats may be even greater in certain types of cells, such as muscle cells.The mutated DMPK gene produces an altered version of messenger RNA, which is a molecular blueprint of the gene that is normally used to guide the production of proteins. Researchers have found that the altered messenger RNA traps proteins to form clumps within the cell. The clumps interfere with the production of many other proteins. These changes prevent muscle cells and cells in other tissues from functioning properly, leading to muscle weakness and the other features of type 1 myotonic dystrophy.The size of the trinucleotide repeat expansion is associated with the severity of signs and symptoms. People with the classic features of type 1 myotonic dystrophy, including muscle weakness and wasting beginning in adulthood, usually have between 100 and 1,000 CTG repeats. People born with the more severe congenital form of type 1 myotonic dystrophy tend to have a larger number of CTG repeats, often more than 2,000. This form of the condition is apparent in infancy and may involve life-threatening health problems.As the altered DMPK gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CTG repeat expansion often increases in size. People with 35 to 49 CTG repeats have not been reported to develop type 1 myotonic dystrophy, but their children are at risk of having the disorder if the number of CTG repeats increases. Repeat lengths from 35 to 49 are called premutations.

The protein binds to specific DNA sequences, and recruits a histone deacetylase to regulate gene expression. Its expression peaks at late G1 phase and continues during G2 and M phases of the cell cycle. It plays a major role in the G1/S transition by regulating topoisomerase IIalpha and retinoblastoma gene expression, and functions in the p53-dependent DNA damage checkpoint. It is regarded as a hub protein for the integration of epigenetic information. This gene is up-regulated in various cancers, and it is therefore considered to be a therapeutic target. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. A related pseudogene exists on chromosome 12. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]From UniProt:Multidomain protein that acts as a key epigenetic regulator by bridging DNA methylation and chromatin modification. Specifically recognizes and binds hemimethylated DNA at replication forks via its YDG domain and recruits DNMT1 methyltransferase to ensure faithful propagation of the DNA methylation patterns through DNA replication. In addition to its role in maintenance of DNA methylation, also plays a key role in chromatin modification: through its tudor-like regions and PHD-type zinc fingers, specifically recognizes and binds histone H3 trimethylated at 'Lys-9' (H3K9me3) and unmethylated at 'Arg-2' (H3R2me0), respectively, and recruits chromatin proteins. Enriched in pericentric heterochromatin where it recruits different chromatin modifiers required for this chromatin replication. Also localizes to euchromatic regions where it negatively regulates transcription possibly by impacting DNA methylation and histone modifications. Has E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity by mediating the ubiquitination of target proteins such as histone H3 and PML. It is still unclear how E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase activity is related to its role in chromatin in vivo. May be involved in DNA repair.

            "GP6\t   The GP6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called glycoprotein VI (GPVI). GPVI is a receptor protein that is embedded in the outer membrane of blood cell fragments called platelets, which are an essential component of blood clots. Normally, blood clots protect the body after an injury by sealing off damaged blood vessels and preventing further blood loss.Receptor proteins, like GPVI, have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell function. The main ligand for GPVI is a protein called collagen, which is found on blood vessel walls. In response to an injury that causes bleeding, the GPVI protein attaches (binds) to collagen, which begins clot formation and signals additional platelets to come together to increase the size of the clot. The GPVI protein can also bind to a protein called fibrin, which is the main protein that forms blood clots.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Glycoprotein VI deficiency     At least five mutations in the GP6 gene have been found to cause glycoprotein VI deficiency, a bleeding disorder associated with a decreased ability to form blood clots. The mutations lead to the production of no GPVI protein; an abnormally short, nonfunctional GPVI protein; or a protein that is less able to bind to collagen. Without GPVI binding to collagen, platelets cannot come together efficiently at the site of an injury to form a clot, leading to an increased risk of nosebleeds, abnormally heavy or prolonged bleeding following minor injury or surgery, or other bleeding problems associated with glycoprotein VI deficiency.

            "AURKC\t   The AURKC gene provides instructions for making a protein called aurora kinase C. This protein regulates certain events during cell division. Cell division occurs when a cell replicates and splits its contents, separating into two new cells. Aurora kinase C helps the two dividing cells separate from each other and ensures that these cells each contain a complete set of chromosomes. Aurora kinase C is most abundant in male testes, which are the male reproductive organs in which sperm are produced and stored. In the testes, this protein regulates the division of sperm cells, ensuring that every new sperm cell divides properly and contains one copy of each chromosome.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Macrozoospermia     At least four mutations in the AURKC gene have been found to cause macrozoospermia. This condition causes males to have abnormal sperm, which leads to an inability to father biological children (infertility). AURKC gene mutations that cause macrozoospermia lead to the production of a nonfunctional protein or a protein that is quickly broken down. One mutation that is a frequent cause of this condition in men of North African descent deletes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) from the AURKC gene (written 144delC). The protein produced from the altered gene is abnormally short and nonfunctional.A lack of aurora kinase C blocks cell division in sperm cells. As a result, sperm cells have extra chromosomes, usually four copies of each instead of the usual one. This increase in chromosome number enlarges the sperm cell head and leads to the presence of multiple tails (flagella). Because of the additional genetic material, if one of these abnormal sperm cells combines with an egg cell, the embryo will not develop or the pregnancy will result in miscarriage.

            "AGL\t   The AGL gene provides instructions for making the glycogen debranching enzyme. This enzyme is involved in the breakdown of a complex sugar called glycogen, which is a major source of stored energy in the body. Glycogen is made up of several molecules of a simple sugar called glucose. Some glucose molecules are linked together in a straight line, while others branch off and form side chains. The glycogen debranching enzyme is involved in the breakdown of these side chains. The branched structure of glycogen makes it more compact for storage and allows it to break down more easily when it is needed for fuel.The AGL gene provides instructions for making several different versions (isoforms) of the glycogen debranching enzyme. These isoforms vary by size and are active (expressed) in different tissues.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Glycogen storage disease type III     Approximately 100 mutations in the AGL gene have been found to cause glycogen storage disease type III (also called GSDIII or Cori disease). Most of these mutations lead to a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the glycogen debranching enzyme, resulting in a nonfunctional enzyme. As a result, the side chains of glycogen molecules cannot be removed and abnormal, partially broken down glycogen molecules are stored within cells. A buildup of abnormal glycogen damages organs and tissues throughout the body, particularly the liver and muscles, leading to the signs and symptoms of GSDIII.Mutations in the AGL gene can affect different isoforms of the enzyme, depending on where the mutations are located in the gene. For example, mutations that occur in a part of the AGL gene called exon 3 affect the isoform that is primarily expressed in the liver. These mutations almost always lead to GSD type IIIb, which is characterized by liver problems.

            "COL11A1\t   The COL11A1 gene provides instructions for making a component of type XI collagen called the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. Collagens are molecules that provide structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type XI collagen is also part of the inner ear; the vitreous, which is the clear gel that fills the eyeball; and the nucleus pulposus, which is the center portion of the discs between the bones of the spine (vertebrae).Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. The pro-alpha1(XI) chain combines with two other collagen chains, pro-alpha2(XI) and pro-alpha1(II), to form a triple-stranded procollagen molecule. Then the ropelike procollagen is processed by enzymes to create mature collagen. Mature collagen molecules arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type XI collagen fibers.Type XI collagen also helps maintain the spacing and width (diameter) of another type of collagen molecule, type II collagen. Type II collagen is an important component of the vitreous and cartilage. The arrangement and size of type II collagen fibrils is essential for the normal structure of these tissues.

Infants with fibrochondrogenesis type 1 have a very narrow chest that prevents the lungs from developing normally. Most children with this condition are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure, although some have lived into childhood.Some cases of fibrochondrogenesis type 1 result from a combination of COL11A1 gene mutations. Specifically, one copy of the gene has a mutation that prevents the production of any functional pro-alpha1(XI) chain, and the other copy has a mutation that results in an abnormal version of the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. When the abnormal chain is incorporated into collagen molecules, it creates defective type XI collagen. The abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues, impairing the formation of bones throughout the skeleton and causing changes in the eye and inner ear that lead to vision and hearing problems.In at least two reported cases, fibrochondrogenesis type 1 has been caused by combinations of COL11A1 gene mutations that completely eliminate the production of the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. Researchers speculate that a loss of this chain changes the structure of type XI collagen molecules and disrupts its ability to form cross-links. However, the effects of these mutations are still under study. More About This Health Condition      Stickler syndrome     Mutations in the COL11A1 gene account for 10 to 20 percent of all cases of Stickler syndrome. When Stickler syndrome results from COL11A1 gene mutations, it is classified as type II. Signs and symptoms of this condition include a distinctive facial appearance, eye abnormalities, hearing loss, and joint problems. These signs and symptoms tend to be less severe than those of fibrochondrogenesis (described above). However, they vary widely among affected individuals.More than two dozen COL11A1 gene mutations have been found in people with Stickler syndrome. Some of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) or delete a small number of amino acids from the pro-alpha1(XI) chain. Other mutations cause segments of DNA to be skipped when the protein is made, resulting in an abnormally short pro-alpha1(XI) chain. All of these changes impair the production or assembly of type XI collagen molecules. Defective collagen disrupts the normal development of connective tissues in many different parts of the body, which leads to the varied signs and symptoms of Stickler syndrome.Mutations in the COL11A1 gene can also cause Marshall syndrome, a condition that is very similar to Stickler syndrome. Some researchers have classified Marshall syndrome as a variant of Stickler syndrome, while others consider it to be a separate disorder. Most of the mutations associated with Marshall syndrome cause a segment of DNA in the COL11A1 gene to be skipped when the protein is made, resulting in an abnormally short pro-alpha1(XI) chain. This shortened protein impairs the formation of mature type XI collagen, which leads to the abnormal development of connective tissues and the signs and symptoms of Marshall syndrome.

More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Several variations in the COL11A1 gene may increase the risk of developing osteoarthritis, a common disease of the joints. Osteoarthritis is characterized by the breakdown of joint cartilage, which causes pain, stiffness, and restricted movement. The genetic changes associated with osteoarthritis are differences in single amino acids in the pro-alpha1(XI) chain of type XI collagen. Studies suggest that the altered pro-alpha1(XI) chain may weaken collagen fibers, which could contribute to the erosion of joint cartilage.

            "AMPD1\t   The AMPD1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) deaminase. This enzyme is found in the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles), where it plays a role in producing energy. Specifically, during physical activity, this enzyme converts a molecule called adenosine monophosphate (AMP) to a molecule called inosine monophosphate (IMP) as part of a process called the purine nucleotide cycle. This cycle reuses molecules called purines, which are a group of building blocks of DNA (nucleotides), its chemical cousin RNA, and molecules such as AMP that serve as energy sources in the cell. As part of the purine nucleotide cycle, AMP deaminase converts AMP to IMP, and as the cycle continues, molecules are produced that the muscle cells can use for energy. Skeletal muscle cells need energy to function and move the body.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Adenosine monophosphate deaminase deficiency     At least nine mutations in the AMPD1 gene have been found to cause AMP deaminase deficiency. This condition is characterized by skeletal muscle pain or weakness after exercise or prolonged physical activity (exercise intolerance). Most cases are caused by a mutation that results in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making AMP deaminase (written as Gly12Ter or Q12X). The resulting enzyme is abnormally short and nonfunctional and cannot participate in the purine nucleotide cycle. As a result, the process stalls and energy production in skeletal muscle cells is decreased. Skeletal muscles are particularly sensitive to decreases in energy during periods of exercise or increased activity when energy demands increase. The lack of AMP deaminase as a source of energy production can result in fatigue and muscle weakness or pain in some people with AMP deaminase deficiency.It is not known why some people with this condition do not experience symptoms. Researchers speculate that additional factors, both genetic and environmental, may determine whether a person develops the signs and symptoms of AMP deaminase deficiency.

            "MTHFR\t   The MTHFR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. This enzyme plays a role in processing amino acids, the building blocks of proteins. Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase is important for a chemical reaction involving forms of the vitamin folate (also called vitamin B9). Specifically, this enzyme converts a molecule called 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate to a molecule called 5-methyltetrahydrofolate. This reaction is required for the multistep process that converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid, methionine. The body uses methionine to make proteins and other important compounds.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Homocystinuria     At least 40 mutations in the MTHFR gene have been identified in people with homocystinuria, a disorder in which the body is unable to process homocysteine and methionine properly. People with this condition often develop eye problems, abnormal blood clotting, skeletal abnormalities, and cognitive problems. Most of the mutations that cause homocystinuria change single amino acids in methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase. These changes impair the function of the enzyme, and some cause the enzyme to be turned off (inactivated). Other mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. Without functional methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, homocysteine cannot be converted to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream, and the amount of methionine is reduced. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine (homocystinuria). Researchers have not determined how altered levels of homocysteine and methionine lead to the various health problems affecting multiple parts of the body in people with homocystinuria.

More About This Health Condition      Anencephaly     Several variations (polymorphisms) in the MTHFR gene have been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, a group of birth defects that occur during the development of the brain and spinal cord. Anencephaly is one of the most common types of neural tube defect. Affected individuals are missing large parts of the brain and have missing or incompletely formed skull bones.The most well-studied polymorphism related to neural tube defects changes a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in the MTHFR gene. Specifically, it replaces the nucleotide cytosine with the nucleotide thymine at position 677 (written as 677C>T). This common variant results in a form of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase that has reduced activity at higher temperatures (thermolabile). People with the 677C>T polymorphism, particularly those with two copies of the genetic change, have elevated levels of homocysteine in their blood resulting from the reduced activity of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase.Researchers have studied MTHFR gene polymorphisms in individuals with neural tube defects and in their mothers, but it remains unclear how these variations could affect the developing brain and spinal cord. The increased risk of neural tube defects may be related to differences in the ability of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase to process folate; a shortage of this vitamin is an established risk factor for neural tube defects.Although MTHFR gene polymorphisms are associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, these variations are common in many populations worldwide. Most people with MTHFR gene polymorphisms do not have neural tube defects, and their children are also typically unaffected. Changes in the MTHFR gene are only one of many genetic and environmental factors that are thought to contribute to these complex conditions. More About This Health Condition      Spina bifida     Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene are also associated with an increased risk of spina bifida, another common type of neural tube defect. In people with this condition, when the spine forms, the bones of the spinal column do not close completely around the developing nerves of the spinal cord. As a result, part of the spinal cord may protrude through an opening in the spine, leading to permanent nerve damage.As described above, variations in the MTHFR gene may increase the risk of neural tube defects by changing the ability of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase to process folate. However, these variations are common in many populations worldwide. Most people with MTHFR gene polymorphisms do not have neural tube defects, nor do their children. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene have also been studied as possible risk factors for a variety of common conditions. These include heart disease, stroke, high blood pressure (hypertension), high blood pressure during pregnancy (preeclampsia), an eye disorder called glaucoma, psychiatric disorders, and certain types of cancer. Research indicates that individuals who have the 677C>T polymorphism on both copies of the MTHFR gene have an increased risk of developing vascular disease, including heart disease and stroke. The 677C>T polymorphism has also been suggested as a risk factor for cleft lip and palate, a birth defect in which there is a split in the upper lip and an opening in the roof of the mouth. Many of the MTHFR gene polymorphisms alter or decrease the activity of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase, leading to an increase of homocysteine in the blood. This increase in homocysteine levels may contribute to the development of many of these conditions.Studies of MTHFR gene variations in people with these disorders have had mixed results, with associations found in some studies but not in others. Therefore, it remains unclear what role changes in the MTHFR gene play in these disorders. It is likely that additional factors influence the processing of homocysteine and that variations in homocysteine levels play a role in whether a person develops any of these conditions. A large number of genetic and environmental factors, most of which remain unknown, likely determine the risk of developing most common, complex conditions.

            "TCHH\t   The TCHH gene provides instructions for making a protein called trichohyalin. This protein is primarily found in hair follicles, which are specialized structures in the skin where hair growth occurs. Trichohyalin can also be found in the hair strand (shaft). Once trichohyalin is produced, it is modified by other proteins so that it can attach (bind) to other trichohyalin proteins and to molecules called keratin intermediate filaments to create organized cross-links. These links form dense networks that give the hair shaft its cylindrical shape.

This condition is characterized by dry, frizzy, blond scalp hair that cannot be combed flat. This condition usually improves over time, and by adolescence individuals with uncombable hair syndrome have hair that lies flat and has normal or nearly normal texture.The TCHH gene mutation that has been identified leads to a premature stop signal in the instructions used to make trichohyalin, resulting in an abnormally short protein with severely reduced activity. A shortage (deficiency) of functional protein reduces the cross-links that are formed between trichohyalin proteins and keratin intermediate filaments.

            "FLG\t   The FLG gene provides instructions for making a large protein called profilaggrin, which is found in cells that make up the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). Profilaggrin is cut (cleaved) to produce multiple copies  of the filaggrin protein, which is important for the structure of the epidermis. The profilaggrin molecule can contain 10, 11, or 12 copies of the filaggrin protein, depending on the genetics of the individual. Further processing of the filaggrin protein produces other molecules that play a role in hydration of the skin.The epidermis acts as a barrier to help minimize water loss and protect the body from foreign substances, including toxins, bacteria, and substances that can cause allergic reactions (allergens), such as pollen and dust mites. Filaggrin plays an important role in the skin's barrier function. It brings together structural proteins in the outermost skin cells to form tight bundles, flattening and strengthening the cells to create a strong barrier. In addition, processing of filaggrin proteins leads to production of molecules that are part of the skin's \"natural moisturizing factor,\" which helps maintain hydration of the skin. These molecules also maintain the correct acidity (pH) of the skin, which is another important aspect of the barrier.

Having a mutation in this gene only increases the risk of developing atopic dermatitis. Not everyone with an FLG gene mutation will develop the disorder. Other genes and environmental factors contribute to atopic dermatitis. Individuals with a mutation in both copies of the FLG gene are at greater risk of developing atopic dermatitis than those with a mutation in only one copy of the gene. The condition is typically more severe in people with two mutated copies.In addition to FLG gene mutations, the number of filaggrin proteins produced from each profilaggrin molecule is associated with development of atopic dermatitis; individuals with genetic instructions for producing 10 copies are at greater risk of developing the disorder than those with instructions for producing 11 or 12 copies.Approximately 40 mutations in the FLG gene have been identified in people with atopic dermatitis. These mutations lead to production of an abnormally short profilaggrin molecule that cannot be cleaved to produce filaggrin proteins. The resulting shortage of filaggrin can impair the barrier function of the skin. Further, a lack of filaggrin leads to a shortage of natural moisturizing factor, which allows excess water to be lost through the skin and causes dry skin in affected individuals.Research suggests that the impairment of the skin's barrier function caused by a shortage of filaggrin contributes to development of allergic disorders. Atopic dermatitis is not initially caused by an allergic reaction, although sometimes substances that can cause allergic reactions (allergens) are thought to contribute to flare-ups of the rashes. In addition, people with atopic dermatitis have an increased likelihood of developing other allergic disorders, including asthma, hay fever, and food allergies. (The tendency to develop allergic disorders is known as atopy.) More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     More than 40 FLG gene mutations have been found to cause a relatively common skin disorder called ichthyosis vulgaris, which is characterized by dry, scaly skin, particularly during the winter when humidity in the air is low. Affected individuals can also have unusually prominent creases on the palms of their hands and soles of their feet (palmar and plantar hyperlinearity) and an increased risk of allergic disorders, including atopic dermatitis (described above). Typically, individuals with a mutation in one copy of the FLG gene are mildly affected; they may have symptoms only seasonally, or they may never have obvious skin problems. Individuals with two mutated copies of the gene have more severe symptoms that may be present year-round.Some of the mutations associated with atopic dermatitis are also found in people with ichthyosis vulgaris. As in atopic dermatitis, the mutations lead to production of an abnormally short profilaggrin molecule that cannot be cleaved to produce filaggrin proteins. A lack of filaggrin and the molecules produced from its processing lead to the dry, scaly skin characteristic of ichthyosis vulgaris. Impairment of the skin's barrier function likely contributes to the development of allergic diseases in some people with ichthyosis vulgaris. Individuals with FLG gene mutations have an increased risk of developing asthma, but only if they also have atopic dermatitis. FLG gene mutations also increase the risk of hay fever, food allergies, and skin sensitivity to nickel, regardless of whether the person has atopic dermatitis. Additional factors, such as living with a cat and smoking tobacco products, may increase the risk of atopic dermatitis and asthma, respectively, in people with ichthyosis vulgaris.

Two main PSS subtypes have been suggested. Patients with non-inflammatory PSS (type A) manifest white scaling, with painless and easy removal of the skin, irritation when in contact with water, dust and sand, and no history of erythema, pruritis or atopy. Inflammatory PSS (type B) is associated with generalized erythema, pruritus and atopy. It is an ichthyosiform erythroderma characterized by lifelong patchy peeling of the entire skin with onset at birth or shortly after. Several patients have been reported with high IgE levels. PSS6 patients manifest generalized ichthyotic dry skin, and bullous peeling lesions on the trunk and limbs at sites of minor trauma. Skin symptoms are exacerbated by warmth and humidity.

            "LOR\t   The LOR gene is part of a cluster of genes on chromosome 1 called the epidermal differentiation complex. These genes are involved in the formation and maintenance of the outer layer of skin (the epidermis), particularly its tough outer surface (the stratum corneum). The stratum corneum, which is formed in a process known as cornification, provides a sturdy barrier between the body and its environment. Each cell of the stratum corneum, called a corneocyte, is surrounded by a protein shell called a cornified envelope.The LOR gene provides instructions for making a protein called loricrin, which is a major component of the cornified envelope. Links between loricrin and other components of the envelopes hold the corneocytes together and help give the stratum corneum its strength.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Vohwinkel syndrome     At least two mutations in the LOR gene have been identified in people with the variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome, sometimes called loricrin keratoderma. This disorder is characterized by skin abnormalities including widespread dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis), especially on the limbs. The mutations that cause the variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome change the structure of the loricrin protein; the altered protein is trapped inside the cell and cannot reach the cornified envelope. While other proteins can partially compensate for the missing loricrin, the envelope of some of the corneocytes is thinner than normal, resulting in the dry, scaly skin (ichthyosis) and other skin abnormalities associated with the variant form of Vohwinkel syndrome.

            "GBA\t   The GBA gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called beta-glucocerebrosidase. This enzyme is active in lysosomes, which are structures inside cells that act as recycling centers. Lysosomes use digestive enzymes to break down toxic substances, digest bacteria that invade the cell, and recycle worn-out cell components. Based on these functions, enzymes in the lysosome are sometimes called housekeeping enzymes. Beta-glucocerebrosidase is a housekeeping enzyme that helps break down a large molecule called glucocerebroside into a sugar (glucose) and a simpler fat molecule (ceramide). Glucocerebroside is a component of the membrane that surrounds cells. It gets broken down by beta-glucocerebrosidase when cells die, and the components are reused as new cells are formed.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Gaucher disease     More than 380 mutations in the GBA gene have been identified in people with Gaucher disease, a disorder with varied features that affect many parts of the body. Affected individuals can have enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), blood cell abnormalities, and rarely, severe neurological problems. The mutations occur in both copies of the gene in each cell. Most of the GBA gene mutations responsible for Gaucher disease change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in beta-glucocerebrosidase, altering the structure of the enzyme and preventing it from working normally. Other mutations delete or insert genetic material in the GBA gene or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the enzyme.Mutations in the GBA gene greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of beta-glucocerebrosidase in cells. As a result, glucocerebroside is not broken down properly. This molecule and related substances can build up in white blood cells called macrophages in the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and other organs. The abnormal accumulation and storage of these substances damages tissues and organs, causing the characteristic features of Gaucher disease. More About This Health Condition      Parkinson disease     Changes in the GBA gene are also associated with Parkinson disease and parkinsonism, which are similar disorders that affect movement. Characteristic features include tremors and impaired balance and coordination (postural instability). People with Gaucher disease (described above) have mutations in both copies of the GBA gene in each cell, while those with a mutation in just one copy of the gene are called carriers. People with Gaucher disease and people who are carriers of a GBA gene mutation have an increased risk of developing Parkinson disease or parkinsonism.Symptoms of Parkinson disease and parkinsonism result from the loss of nerve cells (neurons) that produce dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical messenger that transmits signals within the brain to produce smooth physical movements. It remains unclear how GBA gene mutations are related to these disorders. Studies suggest that changes in this gene may contribute to the faulty breakdown of toxic substances in neurons by impairing the function of lysosomes. Alternatively, the changes may increase the formation of abnormal protein deposits. As a result, toxic substances or protein deposits could accumulate and kill dopamine-producing neurons, leading to abnormal movements and balance problems. More About This Health Condition      Dementia with Lewy bodies     GBA gene mutations can increase the risk of developing dementia with Lewy bodies; however, some people with a mutation in the GBA gene never develop this condition. Dementia with Lewy bodies is characterized by intellectual decline (dementia); visual hallucinations; sudden changes in attention and mood; and movement problems characteristic of Parkinson disease (described above) such as rigidity of limbs, tremors, and impaired balance and coordination.Mutations in one copy of the GBA gene increase the risk of developing dementia with Lewy bodies. These mutations result in the production of an altered beta-glucocerebrosidase enzyme. This abnormal enzyme may interfere with the function of lysosomes and the normal breakdown of a protein called alpha-synuclein, which increases the risk that these proteins accumulate and form Lewy bodies. Accumulation of these protein clusters throughout the brain impairs neuron function and ultimately causes cell death. Over time, the loss of neurons increasingly impairs intellectual and motor function and the regulation of emotions, resulting in the signs and symptoms of dementia with Lewy bodies.

[provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Catalyzes the citrullination/deimination of arginine residues of proteins such as histones, thereby playing a key role in histone code and regulation of stem cell maintenance. Citrullinates histone H1 at 'Arg-54' (to form H1R54ci), histone H3 at 'Arg-2', 'Arg-8', 'Arg-17' and/or 'Arg-26' (to form H3R2ci, H3R8ci, H3R17ci, H3R26ci, respectively) and histone H4 at 'Arg-3' (to form H4R3ci). Acts as a key regulator of stem cell maintenance by mediating citrullination of histone H1: citrullination of 'Arg-54' of histone H1 (H1R54ci) results in H1 displacement from chromatin and global chromatin decondensation, thereby promoting pluripotency and stem cell maintenance. Promotes profound chromatin decondensation during the innate immune response to infection in neutrophils by mediating formation of H1R54ci. Citrullination of histone H3 prevents their methylation by CARM1 and HRMT1L2/PRMT1 and represses transcription.

In INF treated and virus infected cells, RNASEL probably mediates its antiviral effects through a combination of direct cleavage of single-stranded viral RNAs, inhibition of protein synthesis through the degradation of rRNA, induction of apoptosis, and induction of other antiviral genes. RNASEL mediated apoptosis is the result of a JNK-dependent stress-response pathway leading to cytochrome c release from mitochondria and caspase-dependent apoptosis. Therefore, activation of RNASEL could lead to elimination of virus infected cells under some circumstances.

This PTP has been shown to be an essential regulator of T- and B-cell antigen receptor signaling. It functions through either direct interaction with components of the antigen receptor complexes, or by activating various Src family kinases required for the antigen receptor signaling. This PTP also suppresses JAK kinases, and thus functions as a regulator of cytokine receptor signaling. Alternatively spliced transcripts variants of this gene, which encode distinct isoforms, have been reported.

            "CACNA1S\t   The CACNA1S gene belongs to a family of genes that provide instructions for making calcium channels. These channels, which transport positively charged calcium atoms (ions) into cells, play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals.The CACNA1S gene provides instructions for making calcium channels that are abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, these muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contractions are triggered by the flow of certain ions into muscle cells. Channels made with the CACNA1S protein control the transport of calcium ions into muscle cells and are part of the cellular machinery that initiates muscle contractions.Channels made with the CACNA1S protein also activate a protein called ryanodine receptor 1 (produced by the RYR1 gene). Ryanodine receptor 1 forms a channel that releases stored calcium ions within muscle cells in response to certain signals.  The resulting increase in calcium ion concentration stimulates muscle fibers to contract, allowing the body to move.

It is unclear precisely how these changes lead to episodes of muscle weakness in people with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. More About This Health Condition      Malignant hyperthermia     CACNA1S mutations account for a very small percentage of all cases of malignant hyperthermia.

One of these mutations replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid cysteine at protein position 1086 (written as Arg1086Cys); the other mutation replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid histidine at the same protein position (Arg1086His).Genetic mutations likely cause channels made with the CACNA1S protein to activate the RYR1 channel improperly in response to certain drugs (particularly some anesthetics and a type of muscle relaxant used during surgery).  As a result, large amounts of calcium ions are released from storage within muscle cells. An overabundance of available calcium ions causes skeletal muscles to contract abnormally, which leads to muscle rigidity in people with malignant hyperthermia.

            "KISS1\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene is a metastasis suppressor gene that suppresses metastases of melanomas and breast carcinomas without affecting tumorigenicity. The encoded protein may inhibit chemotaxis and invasion and thereby attenuate metastasis in malignant melanomas. Studies suggest a putative role in the regulation of events downstream of cell-matrix adhesion, perhaps involving cytoskeletal reorganization. A protein product of this gene, kisspeptin, stimulates gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH)-induced gonadotropin secretion and regulates the pubertal activation of GnRH nuerons. A polymorphism in the terminal exon of this mRNA results in two protein isoforms. An adenosine present at the polymorphic site represents the third position in a stop codon. When the adenosine is absent, a downstream stop codon is utilized and the encoded protein extends for an additional seven amino acid residues. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2012]From UniProt:Metastasis suppressor protein in malignant melanomas and in some breast cancers. May regulate events downstream of cell-matrix adhesion, perhaps involving cytoskeletal reorganization. Generates a C-terminally amidated peptide, metastin which functions as the endogenous ligand of the G-protein coupled receptor GPR54. Activation of the receptor inhibits cell proliferation and cell migration, key characteristics of tumor metastasis. Kp-10 is a decapeptide derived from the primary translation product, isolated in conditioned medium of first trimester trophoblast. Kp-10, but not other kisspeptins, increased intracellular Ca(2+) levels in isolated first trimester trophoblasts. Kp-10 is a paracrine/endocrine regulator in fine-tuning trophoblast invasion generated by the trophoblast itself. The receptor is also essential for normal gonadotropin-released hormone physiology and for puberty. The hypothalamic KiSS1/GPR54 system is a pivotal factor in central regulation of the gonadotropic axis at puberty and in adulthood.

In some cases, it is associated with non-reproductive phenotypes, such as anosmia, cleft palate, and sensorineural hearing loss. Anosmia or hyposmia is related to the absence or hypoplasia of the olfactory bulbs and tracts. Hypogonadism is due to deficiency in gonadotropin-releasing hormone and probably results from a failure of embryonic migration of gonadotropin-releasing hormone-synthesizing neurons. In the presence of anosmia, idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism is referred to as Kallmann syndrome, whereas in the presence of a normal sense of smell, it has been termed normosmic idiopathic hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (nIHH).

Plays an important role in different aspects of neuronal morphogenesis and migration mainly during development of the cerebral cortex. This includes the biogenesis of neurites, where it is required for both axons and dendrites outgrowth, and the maturation of the dendritic spines. Also stimulates the branching of the leading process and negatively regulates neuron radial migration in the cerebral cortex. Its interaction and inhibition by SRGAP2C reduces the rate of spine maturation, alters dendritic spine morphology and density and indirectly increases neuronal migration. It may have implications for cognition, learning and memory. In non-neuronal cells, it may also play a role in cell migration by regulating the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia.

            "HSPG2\t   The HSPG2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called perlecan. This protein is found in the extracellular matrix, which is the intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that forms in the spaces between cells. Specifically, it is found in part of the extracellular matrix called the basement membrane, which is a thin, sheet-like structure that separates and supports cells in many tissues. Perlecan is also found in cartilage, a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears.Perlecan is a heparan sulfate proteoglycan, which is a type of protein that interacts with many other proteins and has a variety of functions. In particular, perlecan is involved in cell signaling, the sticking (adhesion) of cells to one another, the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), and the maintenance of basement membranes and cartilage throughout life. The protein also plays a critical role at the neuromuscular junction, which is the area between the ends of nerve cells and muscle cells where signals are relayed to trigger muscle contraction.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Schwartz-Jampel syndrome     More than 30 mutations in the HSPG2 gene have been found to cause Schwartz-Jampel syndrome. This rare condition is characterized by continuous muscle contraction (myotonia) that restricts movement, as well as bone abnormalities known as chondrodysplasia. Most of the mutations reduce the amount of perlecan that is produced. Other mutations lead to a version of perlecan that is only partially functional. A reduction in the amount or function of this protein disrupts the normal development of cartilage and bone tissue, which underlies chondrodysplasia in affected individuals. A reduced amount of functional perlecan at the neuromuscular junction likely alters the balance of other molecules that signal when muscles should contract and when they should relax. As a result, muscle contraction is triggered continuously, leading to myotonia. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Mutations in the HSPG2 gene can also cause another, more severe form of chondrodysplasia called dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type. Because of the very severe abnormalities associated with this rare condition, most affected individuals die before birth, are stillborn, or live only into early infancy. At least seven HSPG2 gene mutations have been identified in people with dyssegmental dysplasia, Silverman-Handmaker type. These mutations prevent the production or transport of any functional perlecan. A total lack of this protein significantly disrupts the development of cartilage and bone tissue, causing this very severe type of chondrodysplasia.

            "AGT\t   The AGT gene provides instructions for making a protein called angiotensinogen. This protein is part of the renin-angiotensin system, which regulates blood pressure and the balance of fluids and salts in the body. In the first step of this process, angiotensinogen is converted to angiotensin I. Through an additional step, angiotensin I is converted to angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes blood vessels to narrow (constrict), which results in increased blood pressure. This molecule also stimulates production of the hormone aldosterone, which triggers the absorption of salt and water by the kidneys. The increased amount of fluid in the body also increases blood pressure. Proper blood pressure during fetal growth, which delivers oxygen to the developing tissues, is required for normal development of the kidneys, particularly of structures called the proximal tubules, and other tissues. In addition, angiotensin II may play a more direct role in kidney development, perhaps by affecting growth factors involved in the development of kidney structures.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Renal tubular dysgenesis     At least six mutations in the AGT gene have been found to cause a severe kidney disorder called renal tubular dysgenesis. This condition is characterized by abnormal kidney development before birth, the inability to produce urine (anuria), and severe low blood pressure (hypotension). These problems result in a reduction of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios), which leads to a set of birth defects known as the Potter sequence.Renal tubular dysgenesis can be caused by mutations in both copies of any of the genes involved in the renin-angiotensin system. Most of the mutations in the AGT gene that cause this disorder change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the angiotensinogen protein. These changes occur in a region of the protein that is necessary for its conversion to angiotensin I. It is thought that the altered angiotensinogen cannot be converted, leading to a nonfunctional renin-angiotensin system. Without this system, the kidneys cannot control blood pressure. Because of low blood pressure, the flow of blood is reduced (hypoperfusion), and the body does not get enough oxygen during fetal development. As a result, kidney development is impaired, leading to the features of renal tubular dysgenesis. More About This Health Condition      Hypertension     Genetics Home Reference provides information about hypertension. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Variations in the AGT gene are associated with susceptibility to a form of high blood pressure (hypertension) called essential hypertension.

            "STIL\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a cytoplasmic protein implicated in regulation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, a regulatory pathway that monitors chromosome segregation during cell division to ensure the proper distribution of chromosomes to daughter cells. The protein is phosphorylated in mitosis and in response to activation of the spindle checkpoint, and disappears when cells transition to G1 phase. It interacts with a mitotic regulator, and its expression is required to efficiently activate the spindle checkpoint. It is proposed to regulate Cdc2 kinase activity during spindle checkpoint arrest. Chromosomal deletions that fuse this gene and the adjacent locus commonly occur in T cell leukemias, and are thought to arise through illegitimate V-(D)-J recombination events. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Immediate-early gene. Plays an important role in embryonic development as well as in cellular growth and proliferation; its long-term silencing affects cell survival and cell cycle distribution as well as decreases CDK1 activity correlated with reduced phosphorylation of CDK1. Plays a role as a positive regulator of the sonic hedgehog pathway, acting downstream of PTCH1 (PubMed:16024801, PubMed:9372240). Plays an important role in the regulation of centriole duplication. Required for the onset of procentriole formation and proper mitotic progression. During procentriole formation, is essential for the correct loading of SASS6 and CENPJ to the base of the procentriole to initiate procentriole assembly (PubMed:22020124).

Brain weight is markedly reduced and the cerebral cortex is disproportionately small. Despite this marked reduction in size, the gyral pattern is relatively well preserved, with no major abnormality in cortical architecture. Affected individuals are mentally retarded. Primary microcephaly is further defined by the absence of other syndromic features or significant neurological deficits due to degenerative brain disorder. [MIM:612703]A chromosomal aberration involving STIL may be a cause of some T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL). A deletion at 1p32 between STIL and TAL1 genes leads to STIL/TAL1 fusion mRNA with STIL exon 1 splicing to TAL1 exon 3. As both STIL exon 1 and TAL1 exon 3 are 5'-untranslated exons, STIL/TAL1 fusion mRNA predicts a full-length TAL1 protein under the control of the STIL promoter, leading to inappropriate TAL1 expression. In childhood T-cell malignancies (T-ALL), a type of defect such as STIL/TAL1 fusion is associated with a good prognosis. In cultured lymphocytes from healthy adults, STIL/TAL1 fusion mRNA may be detected after 7 days of culture.

Low density lipoprotein receptors are cell surface proteins that play roles in both signal transduction and receptor-mediated endocytosis of specific ligands for lysosomal degradation. The encoded protein plays a critical role in the migration of neurons during development by mediating Reelin signaling, and also functions as a receptor for the cholesterol transport protein apolipoprotein E. Expression of this gene may be a marker for major depressive disorder. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding multiple isoforms have been observed for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jun 2011]From UniProt:Cell surface receptor for Reelin (RELN) and apolipoprotein E (apoE)-containing ligands. LRP8 participates in transmitting the extracellular Reelin signal to intracellular signaling processes, by binding to DAB1 on its cytoplasmic tail. Reelin acts via both the VLDL receptor (VLDLR) and LRP8 to regulate DAB1 tyrosine phosphorylation and microtubule function in neurons. LRP8 has higher affinity for Reelin than VLDLR. LRP8 is thus a key component of the Reelin pathway which governs neuronal layering of the forebrain during embryonic brain development. Binds the endoplasmic reticulum resident receptor-associated protein (RAP). Binds dimers of beta 2-glycoprotein I and may be involved in the suppression of platelet aggregation in the vasculature. Highly expressed in the initial segment of the epididymis, where it affects the functional expression of clusterin and phospholipid hydroperoxide glutathione peroxidase (PHGPx), two proteins required for sperm maturation. May also function as an endocytic receptor. Not required for endocytic uptake of SEPP1 in the kidney which is mediated by LRP2 (By similarity). Together with its ligand, apolipoprotein E (apoE), may indirectly play a role in the suppression of the innate immune response by controlling the survival of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (By similarity).

            "LEPR\t   The LEPR gene  provides instructions for making a protein called the leptin receptor, which is involved in the regulation of body weight. The leptin receptor protein is found on the surface of cells in many organs and tissues of the body, including a part of the brain called the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus controls hunger and thirst as well as other functions such as sleep, moods, and body temperature. It also regulates the release of many hormones that have functions throughout the body.The leptin receptor is turned on (activated) by a hormone called leptin that attaches (binds) to the receptor, fitting into it like a key into a lock. Normally, the body's fat cells release leptin in proportion to their size. As fat cells become larger, they produce more leptin. This rise in leptin indicates that fat stores are increasing. In the hypothalamus, the binding of leptin to its receptor triggers a series of chemical signals that affect hunger and help produce a feeling of fullness (satiety).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Leptin receptor deficiency     At least 18 LEPR gene mutations that cause leptin receptor deficiency have been identified; this disorder is associated with excessive hunger, massive weight gain, and reduced production of hormones that direct sexual development (hypogonadotropic hypogonadism). Some of the mutations result in less receptor protein getting to the cell surface where leptin binding takes place. The receptors that get to the cell surface may bind to leptin, but their signaling function is impaired. The resulting shortage of leptin signaling disrupts normal feelings of hunger and satiety, leading to extreme weight gain.Because hypogonadotropic hypogonadism occurs in leptin receptor deficiency, researchers suggest that leptin receptor signaling is also involved in regulating the body's response to hormones that control sexual development, and that this response is affected by LEPR gene mutations.

            "PER3\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene is a member of the Period family of genes and is expressed in a circadian pattern in the suprachiasmatic nucleus, the primary circadian pacemaker in the mammalian brain. Genes in this family encode components of the circadian rhythms of locomotor activity, metabolism, and behavior. This gene is upregulated by CLOCK/ARNTL heterodimers but then represses this upregulation in a feedback loop using PER/CRY heterodimers to interact with CLOCK/ARNTL. Polymorphisms in this gene have been linked to sleep disorders. Multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]From UniProt:Originally described as a core component of the circadian clock. The circadian clock, an internal time-keeping system, regulates various physiological processes through the generation of approximately 24 hour circadian rhythms in gene expression, which are translated into rhythms in metabolism and behavior. It is derived from the Latin roots 'circa' (about) and 'diem' (day) and acts as an important regulator of a wide array of physiological functions including metabolism, sleep, body temperature, blood pressure, endocrine, immune, cardiovascular, and renal function. Consists of two major components: the central clock, residing in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the brain, and the peripheral clocks that are present in nearly every tissue and organ system. Both the central and peripheral clocks can be reset by environmental cues, also known as Zeitgebers (German for 'timegivers'). The predominant Zeitgeber for the central clock is light, which is sensed by retina and signals directly to the SCN. The central clock entrains the peripheral clocks through neuronal and hormonal signals, body temperature and feeding-related cues, aligning all clocks with the external light/dark cycle. Circadian rhythms allow an organism to achieve temporal homeostasis with its environment at the molecular level by regulating gene expression to create a peak of protein expression once every 24 hours to control when a particular physiological process is most active with respect to the solar day. Transcription and translation of core clock components (CLOCK, NPAS2, ARNTL/BMAL1, ARNTL2/BMAL2, PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY1 and CRY2) plays a critical role in rhythm generation, whereas delays imposed by post-translational modifications (PTMs) are important for determining the period (tau) of the rhythms (tau refers to the period of a rhythm and is the length, in time, of one complete cycle). A diurnal rhythm is synchronized with the day/night cycle, while the ultradian and infradian rhythms have a period shorter and longer than 24 hours, respectively. Disruptions in the circadian rhythms contribute to the pathology of cardiovascular diseases, cancer, metabolic syndromes and aging. A transcription/translation feedback loop (TTFL) forms the core of the molecular circadian clock mechanism. Transcription factors, CLOCK or NPAS2 and ARNTL/BMAL1 or ARNTL2/BMAL2, form the positive limb of the feedback loop, act in the form of a heterodimer and activate the transcription of core clock genes and clock-controlled genes (involved in key metabolic processes), harboring E-box elements (5'-CACGTG-3') within their promoters. The core clock genes: PER1/2/3 and CRY1/2 which are transcriptional repressors form the negative limb of the feedback loop and interact with the CLOCK|NPAS2-ARNTL/BMAL1|ARNTL2/BMAL2 heterodimer inhibiting its activity and thereby negatively regulating their own expression. This heterodimer also activates nuclear receptors NR1D1, NR1D2, RORA, RORB and RORG, which form a second feedback loop and which activate and repress ARNTL/BMAL1 transcription, respectively. Has a redundant role with the other PER proteins PER1 and PER2 and is not essential for the circadian rhythms maintenance. In contrast, plays an important role in sleep-wake timing and sleep homeostasis probably through the transcriptional regulation of sleep homeostasis-related genes, without influencing circadian parameters.

            "ABCA4\t   The ABCA4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in the retina, the specialized light-sensitive tissue that lines the back of the eye. Specifically, the ABCA4 protein is produced in the retina's light receptor cells (photoreceptors). The ABCA4 protein is active following phototransduction, the process by which light entering the eye is converted into electrical signals that are transmitted to the brain. Phototransduction leads to the formation of potentially toxic substances that can damage photoreceptor cells. The ABCA4 protein removes one of these substances, called N-retinylidene-PE, from photoreceptor cells.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Cone-rod dystrophy     More than 40 mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause a vision disorder called cone-rod dystrophy. The problems associated with this condition include a loss of visual sharpness (acuity), an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia), and impaired color vision. These vision problems worsen over time. It is estimated that ABCA4 gene mutations account for 30 to 60 percent of cases of cone-rod dystrophy that are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means that both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.Most of the ABCA4 gene mutations that cause cone-rod dystrophy change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the ABCA4 protein. The altered protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptor cells. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a molecule called N-retinylidene-N-retinylethanolamine (A2E), which builds up in these cells. The buildup of A2E is toxic to photoreceptor cells and leads to their deterioration, causing progressive vision loss in people with cone-rod dystrophy. Cone-rod dystrophy caused by ABCA4 gene mutations tends to be associated with more severe vision problems than cone-rod dystrophy caused by other genetic mutations. More About This Health Condition      Stargardt macular degeneration     More than 640 mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been found to cause Stargardt macular degeneration. Mutations in this gene are the most common cause of this eye disease. Stargardt macular degeneration is characterized by vision loss that worsens over time, particularly affecting central and night vision. Most of these mutations change amino acids in the ABCA4 protein. A malfunctioning ABCA4 protein cannot remove N-retinylidene-PE from photoreceptor cells. As a result, N-retinylidene-PE combines with another substance to produce a fatty yellow pigment called lipofuscin, which builds up in retinal cells. The buildup of lipofuscin is toxic to the cells of the retina and causes progressive vision loss in people with Stargardt macular degeneration.Several ABCA4 gene mutations have been found to cause different forms of vision loss in different individuals.

Additional post-translational modifications occur to add glycosaminoglycans and disulfide bonds. In one family with congenital myasthenic syndrome affecting limb-girdle muscles, a mutation in this gene was found. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2015]From UniProt:Isoform 2: transmembrane form that is the predominate form in neurons of the brain, induces dendritic filopodia and synapse formation in mature hippocampal neurons in large part due to the attached glycosaminoglycan chains and the action of Rho-family GTPases.Isoform 1: heparan sulfate basal lamina glycoprotein that plays a central role in the formation and the maintenance of the neuromuscular junction (NMJ) and directs key events in postsynaptic differentiation. Component of the AGRN-LRP4 receptor complex that induces the phosphorylation and activation of MUSK. The activation of MUSK in myotubes induces the formation of NMJ by regulating different processes including the transcription of specific genes and the clustering of AChR in the postsynaptic membrane. Calcium ions are required for maximal AChR clustering. AGRN function in neurons is highly regulated by alternative splicing, glycan binding and proteolytic processing. Modulates calcium ion homeostasis in neurons, specifically by inducing an increase in cytoplasmic calcium ions. Functions differentially in the central nervous system (CNS) by inhibiting the alpha(3)-subtype of Na+/K+-ATPase and evoking depolarization at CNS synapses. This secreted isoform forms a bridge, after release from motor neurons, to basal lamina through binding laminin via the NtA domain.Isoform 3 and isoform 6: lack any 'z' insert, are muscle-specific and may be involved in endothelial cell differentiation.Agrin N-terminal 110 kDa subunit: is involved in regulation of neurite outgrowth probably due to the presence of the glycosaminoglcan (GAG) side chains of heparan and chondroitin sulfate attached to the Ser/Thr- and Gly/Ser-rich regions. Also involved in modulation of growth factor signaling (By similarity).Isoform 1, isoform 4 and isoform 5: neuron-specific (z+) isoforms that contain C-terminal insertions of 8-19 AA are potent activators of AChR clustering.

These COPII vesicles carry proteins that are destined to be exported out of cells (secreted).The SEC23B protein is very similar to the protein produced from a related gene, SEC23A. These proteins are both components of COPII, and they appear to have overlapping functions. In most types of cells, if one of these proteins is missing, the other may be able to compensate for the loss. However, research indicates that the SEC23B protein may have a unique function in developing red blood cells (erythroblasts).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia     At least 20 mutations in the SEC23B gene have been identified in people with congenital dyserythropoietic anemia (CDA) type II. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the SEC23B protein. Other mutations delete genetic material from the SEC23B gene or alter the way the gene's instructions are used to make the SEC23B protein. The mutations responsible for CDA type II likely disrupt the function of the SEC23B protein. However, researchers suspect that these mutations do not completely eliminate the function of the protein, which appears to be essential for life.It is unclear how SEC23B mutations cause the characteristic features of CDA type II. The abnormal SEC23B protein leads to the production of erythroblasts that are unusually shaped and may have extra nuclei. These defective erythroblasts cannot develop into functional mature red blood cells. The resulting shortage of healthy red blood cells leads to the characteristic signs and symptoms of anemia, as well as complications including an enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly) and an abnormal buildup of iron that can damage the body's organs.

            "SLC52A3\t   The SLC52A3 gene (previously called the C20orf54 gene) provides instructions for making a riboflavin transporter protein called RFVT3 (formerly known as RFT2). This protein moves (transports) a vitamin called riboflavin (also called vitamin B2) across the cell membrane. Riboflavin cannot be made by the body, so it must be obtained from the food a person eats. The RFVT3 protein is found at especially high levels in cells of the small intestine and is important for absorbing riboflavin during digestion so that the vitamin can be used in the body.In the cells of the body, riboflavin is the core component of molecules called flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) and flavin mononucleotide (FMN). These molecules function as coenzymes, which means they help enzymes carry out chemical reactions. FAD and FMN are involved in many different chemical reactions and are required for a variety of cellular processes. One important role of these coenzymes is in the production of energy for cells. FAD and FMN are also involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy     More than two dozen mutations in the SLC52A3 gene have been found to cause riboflavin transporter deficiency neuronopathy. This neurological condition encompasses two disorders that were previously considered to be separate: Brown-Vialetto-Van Laere syndrome and Fazio-Londe disease. The gene mutations involved in this condition lead to production of abnormal RFVT3 proteins. Some mutations lead to the production of an altered protein that cannot get to the cell membrane, so it is unable to transport riboflavin into the cell. Other mutations lead to a version of the protein that can get to the cell membrane, but its function as a transporter is impaired. These changes impair the absorption of riboflavin in the small intestine. The resulting shortage of riboflavin leads to a reduction of FAD and FMN. However, it is unclear how these changes lead to the nerve problems that cause hearing loss, muscle weakness in the face and limbs, and breathing problems in people with the disorder.

            "PLCB4\t   The PLCB4 gene provides instructions for making one form (the beta 4 isoform) of a protein called phospholipase C. This protein is involved in a signaling pathway within cells known as the phosphoinositide cycle, which helps transmit information from outside the cell to inside the cell. Phospholipase C carries out one particular step in the phosphoinositide cycle: the conversion of a molecule called phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) to two smaller molecules, inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP3) and 1,2-diacylglycerol. These smaller molecules relay messages into the cell that ultimately influence many cell activities.Studies suggest that the beta 4 isoform of phospholipase C contributes to the development of the first and second pharyngeal arches. These embryonic structures ultimately develop into the jawbones, facial muscles, middle ear bones, ear canals, outer ears, and related tissues. This protein is also thought to play a role in vision, particularly in the function of the retina, which is a specialized tissue at the back of the eye that detects light and color.

The identified mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the the beta 4 isoform of phospholipase C. These changes likely alter the structure of the protein and impair the phosphoinositide cycle. Abnormal signaling alters the formation of the lower jaw: instead of developing normally, the lower jaw becomes shaped more like the smaller upper jaw (maxilla). The abnormal shape leads to an unusually small chin (micrognathia) and problems with jaw function.

            "ITGB2\t   The ITGB2 gene provides instructions for making one part (the β2 subunit) of at least four different proteins known as β2 integrins. The other subunit can be one of a variety of alpha (α) subunits that are produced from different genes. Integrins are a group of proteins that regulate the attachment of cells to one another (cell-cell adhesion) and to the surrounding network of proteins and other molecules (cell-matrix adhesion). Integrins also transmit signals that regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes.Integrins that contain the β2 subunit are found embedded in the membrane that surrounds white blood cells (leukocytes). β2 integrins help leukocytes gather at sites of infection or injury, where they are needed to contribute to the immune response. β2 integrins recognize signs of inflammation and attach (bind) to proteins called ligands on the lining of blood vessels. This binding leads to linkage (adhesion) of the leukocyte to the blood vessel wall. Signaling through the β2 integrins triggers the transport of the attached leukocyte across the blood vessel wall to the site of infection or injury.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1     At least 90 mutations in the ITGB2 gene have been found to cause leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1. This condition is characterized by severe, recurrent infections and delayed healing after injury. Many of the mutations that cause this condition change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the β2 subunit and lead to the production of a β2 subunit that cannot bind with other subunits to form integrins. Rarely, defective β2 subunits are able to form integrins, but the integrins cannot bind ligands. Leukocytes that lack these integrins cannot attach to the blood vessel wall or cross the vessel wall to contribute to the immune response. As a result, there is a decreased response to injury and foreign invaders, such as bacteria and fungi, resulting in frequent infections, delayed wound healing, and other signs and symptoms of leukocyte adhesion deficiency type 1.

            "COL18A1\t   The COL18A1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms collagen XVIII. Three COL18A1 proteins, called alpha 1 subunits, attach to each other to form collagen XVIII. Collagen XVIII is found in the basement membranes of tissues throughout the body. Basement membranes are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in these tissues.There are three versions (isoforms) of the alpha 1 subunit of collagen XVIII, which form three different lengths of the collagen XVIII protein. The short version of collagen XVIII is found in basement membranes throughout the body, including several parts of the eye. The two longer versions are found primarily in the liver. In addition, a piece of collagen XVIII can be cut off to form the protein endostatin. Endostatin is able to block the formation of blood vessels (angiogenesis) and is known as an anti-angiogenic factor.Little is known about the function of collagen XVIII, but it appears that all of the isoforms are involved in normal development of the eye.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Knobloch syndrome     At least a dozen mutations in the COL18A1 gene have been identified in people with Knobloch syndrome, a condition characterized by severe vision problems and a skull defect called an occipital encephalocele. Most COL18A1 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the genetic blueprint used to make the alpha 1 subunit of collagen XVIII. There are a few other mutations that replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein sequence. Although the process is unclear, the COL18A1 gene mutations result in the loss of collagen XVIII. Most COL18A1 gene mutations affect all isoforms of collagen XVIII, but at least one mutation affects only the short isoform. The loss of one or all isoforms of the collagen XVIII protein likely causes the signs and symptoms of Knobloch syndrome. It is unclear whether endostatin is involved in this condition.

            "COL6A2\t   The COL6A2 gene provides instructions for making one component of type VI collagen, which is a flexible protein found in the space that surrounds cells. Specifically, the protein produced from the COL6A2 gene is the alpha(α)2(VI) chain of type VI collagen. This chain combines with chains produced from other genes to produce a complete type VI collagen molecule.Collagens are found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support. Type VI collagen is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding cells that make up the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle cells) and cells that make up connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including skin and joints. The extracellular matrix is necessary for cell stability and growth. Research suggests that type VI collagen links basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that are part of the extracellular matrix, to nearby cells.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Collagen VI-related myopathy     Mutations in the COL6A2 gene have been found to cause some cases of collagen VI-related myopathy, which is a group of disorders that vary in severity but generally result in muscle weakness and joint deformities called contractures. These mutations often change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α2(VI) chain. The most frequently affected amino acid is glycine; changes to this building block disrupt the structure of the α2(VI) chain. Other mutations can also disrupt the structure of the α2(VI) chain.Mutations in the COL6A2 gene affect type VI collagen in different ways. Some mutations lead to altered α2(VI) chains that can be incorporated into the mature type VI collagen molecule, although they disrupt the molecule's structure and function. Other mutations result in an altered chain that cannot be incorporated at all. Still other mutations prevent the production of any functional α2(VI) chain, which impedes formation of type VI collagen. All of these COL6A2 gene mutations lead to a reduction or absence of functional collagen VI molecules. While it is difficult to predict the severity of collagen VI-related myopathy based on the type of mutation, in general, lower amounts of type VI collagen lead to more severe signs and symptoms that begin earlier in life.Changes in α2(VI) chain structure or production lead to an unstable extracellular matrix that is no longer attached to cells through the basement membrane. As a result, the stability of muscle cells and connective tissue progressively declines, which leads to the muscle weakness, contractures, and other signs and symptoms of collagen VI-related myopathy.

            "TXNRD2\t   From NCBI Gene:The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the pyridine nucleotide-disulfide oxidoreductase family, and is a member of the thioredoxin (Trx) system. Three thioredoxin reductase (TrxR) isozymes are found in mammals. TrxRs are selenocysteine-containing flavoenzymes, which reduce thioredoxins, as well as other substrates, and play a key role in redox homoeostasis. This gene encodes a mitochondrial form important for scavenging reactive oxygen species in mitochondria. It functions as a homodimer containing FAD, and selenocysteine (Sec) at the active site. Sec is encoded by UGA codon that normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, which is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon rather than as a stop signal. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms, including a few localized in the cytosol and some lacking the C-terminal Sec residue, have been found for this gene.

Its Poz domain is thought to function as a site for protein-protein interaction and is required for transcriptional repression, and the zinc-fingers comprise the DNA binding domain. Since the encoded protein has typical features of a transcription factor, it is postulated to be a repressor of gene expression. In small round cell sarcoma, this gene is fused to EWS by a small inversion of 22q, then the hybrid is thought to be translocated (t(1;22)(p36.1;q12). The rearrangement of chromosome 22 involves intron 8 of EWS and exon 1 of this gene creating a chimeric sequence containing the transactivation domain of EWS fused to zinc finger domain of this protein.

This protein is part of a signaling pathway that controls the levels of another protein called hepcidin, which is a key regulator of iron balance in the body. When blood iron levels are low, this signaling pathway reduces hepcidin production, allowing more iron from the diet to be absorbed through the intestines and transported out of storage sites (particularly in the liver and spleen) into the bloodstream. Iron is an essential component of hemoglobin, which is the molecule in red blood cells that carries oxygen.

This condition is characterized by a shortage (deficiency) of iron in the bloodstream that is resistant (refractory) to treatment with iron.TMPRSS6 gene mutations greatly reduce the amount of functional matriptase-2, preventing it from controlling hepcidin levels. The resulting elevation in hepcidin activity blocks the absorption of iron through the intestines and the release of iron from storage. When not enough iron is available in the bloodstream, less hemoglobin is produced and red blood cells cannot carry oxygen to the body's cells and tissues effectively.

The flamingo subfamily consists of nonclassic-type cadherins; a subpopulation that does not interact with catenins. The flamingo cadherins are located at the plasma membrane and have nine cadherin domains, seven epidermal growth factor-like repeats and two laminin A G-type repeats in their ectodomain. They also have seven transmembrane domains, a characteristic unique to this subfamily. It is postulated that these proteins are receptors involved in contact-mediated communication, with cadherin domains acting as homophilic binding regions and the EGF-like domains involved in cell adhesion and receptor-ligand interactions. This particular member is a developmentally regulated, neural-specific gene which plays an unspecified role in early embryogenesis.

            "MLC1\t   The MLC1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found primarily in the brain but also in the spleen and white blood cells (leukocytes). Within the brain, the MLC1 protein is found in astroglial cells, which are a specialized form of brain cells called glial cells. Glial cells protect and maintain other nerve cells (neurons). The MLC1 protein functions at junctions that connect neighboring astroglial cells. The role of the MLC1 protein at the cell junction is unknown, but research suggests that it may control the flow of fluids into cells or the strength of cells' attachment to one another (cell adhesion). Studies indicate that the MLC1 protein may be involved in transporting molecules across the blood-brain barrier and the brain-cerebrospinal fluid barrier. These barriers protect the brain's delicate nerve tissue by allowing only certain substances to pass into the brain.

This enzyme is located in cellular structures called lysosomes, which are the cell's recycling centers. Within lysosomes, arylsulfatase A helps process substances known as sulfatides. Sulfatides are a subgroup of sphingolipids, a category of fats that are important components of cell membranes. Sulfatides are abundant in the nervous system's white matter, consisting of nerve fibers covered by myelin. Myelin, made up of multiple layers of membranes, insulates and protects nerves.

These mutations greatly reduce the activity of arylsulfatase A. Severe disruption in arylsulfatase A activity interferes with the breakdown of sulfatides. As a result, these substances can accumulate to toxic levels in the nervous system. The buildup of sulfatides gradually destroys the cells that produce myelin, the covering that protects nerves and promotes the efficient transmission of nerve impulses. Destruction of myelin leads to the loss of white matter (leukodystrophy) and impairment of nervous system function, resulting in the signs and symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy.In some cases, individuals with very low arylsulfatase A activity show no signs or symptoms of metachromatic leukodystrophy. This condition, called pseudoarylsulfatase deficiency, seems to be caused by specific variations of the ARSA gene.

            "IL1A\t   The IL1A gene provides instructions for making a protein called interleukin-1 alpha. Interleukins are a group of proteins that are made primarily in immune system cells.  They are involved in cell-to-cell communication and have a wide variety of functions within the immune system. Interleukin-1 alpha is described as \"pro-inflammatory\" because it stimulates the activity of genes involved in inflammation and immunity. This protein plays a critical role in protecting the body from foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses.  It is also involved in bone resorption, the breakdown and removal of bone tissue that is no longer needed.Interleukin-1 alpha is initially produced as a relatively long protein that is trapped within cells. Another protein, called calpain, cuts (cleaves) this precursor protein to create a shorter, mature version of interleukin-1 alpha. The shorter form of this protein is secreted by immune system cells to influence the functions of other cells.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Ankylosing spondylitis     Several variations (polymorphisms) in the IL1A gene have been found to influence the risk of ankylosing spondylitis.  Each of these variations changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in interleukin-1 alpha. It is unclear how these variations alter the protein's function. Studies suggest that the effects of IL1A variations are probably related to the role of interleukin-1 alpha in promoting inflammation. Other genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown, also affect the chance of developing ankylosing spondylitis.

These include chronic gum (periodontal) disease, a progressive bone infection known as chronic osteomyelitis, and an eye disease called open-angle glaucoma.The most well-studied variation affecting the IL1A gene is a change in a single DNA building block (nucleotide) in a region of regulatory DNA near the start of the gene (written as IL1A-889 C>T). This variation affects the production of interleukin-1 alpha within cells. Researchers have also identified a second common variation in the IL1A gene, written as IL1A+4845 G>T, which changes a single nucleotide in the gene. This variation likely affects the sensitivity of interleukin-1 alpha to cleavage by calpain.It is unclear how changes in the IL1A gene influence the risk of inflammatory disorders.

Expression of this gene is required for adipocyte differentiation and it also functions as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator with some peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors to modulate expression of other genes involved in lipid metabolism. Mutations in this gene are associated with metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, acute recurrent rhabdomyolysis, and autosomal recessive acute recurrent myoglobinuria (ARARM). This gene is also a candidate for several human lipodystrophy syndromes. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2017]From UniProt:Plays important roles in controlling the metabolism of fatty acids at different levels. Acts as a magnesium-dependent phosphatidate phosphatase enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of phosphatidic acid to diacylglycerol during triglyceride, phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis in the reticulum endoplasmic membrane. Acts also as a nuclear transcriptional coactivator for PPARGC1A/PPARA to modulate lipid metabolism gene expression (By similarity). Is involved in adipocyte differentiation.

It is a minor species carried by human erythrocytes, but plays an important role in regulating the mechanical stability of red cells. A number of glycophorin C mutations have been described. The Gerbich and Yus phenotypes are due to deletion of exon 3 and 2, respectively. The Webb and Duch antigens, also known as glycophorin D, result from single point mutations of the glycophorin C gene. The glycophorin C protein has very little homology with glycophorins A and B. Alternate splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2012]From UniProt:This protein is a minor sialoglycoprotein in human erythrocyte membranes.

            "TPO\t   The TPO gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called thyroid peroxidase. This enzyme plays a central role in the function of the thyroid gland, a butterfly-shaped tissue in the lower neck. Thyroid peroxidase assists the chemical reaction that adds iodine to a protein called thyroglobulin, a critical step in generating thyroid hormones. Thyroid hormones play an important role in regulating growth, brain development, and the rate of chemical reactions in the body (metabolism).To function properly, thyroid peroxidase must be located in the cell membrane of certain thyroid cells, called follicular cells. Thyroid peroxidase has several different versions (isoforms), which vary by size and location within the cell. Some versions do not function because they are not located in the cell membrane.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Congenital hypothyroidism     TPO gene mutations can cause congenital hypothyroidism, a condition characterized by abnormally low levels of thyroid hormones starting from birth. The TPO gene mutations involved in this condition delete, add, or change DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the TPO gene. Some mutations lead to an abnormally small thyroid peroxidase enzyme that breaks apart before it can be inserted into the cell membrane. Other mutations change the enzyme's 3-dimensional shape, preventing it from functioning properly within the cell membrane. Without functional thyroid peroxidase, iodine taken up by the thyroid gland is not added to thyroglobulin. As a result, the production of thyroid hormones is absent or reduced, leading to the features of congenital hypothyroidism. In most affected individuals, the thyroid gland is enlarged (goiter) in an attempt to compensate for reduced hormone production. Because cases caused by TPO gene mutations result from a disruption of thyroid hormone synthesis, they are classified as thyroid dyshormonogenesis.

            "IFIH1\t   The IFIH1 gene provides instructions for making the MDA5 protein, which plays an important role in innate immunity, the body's early, nonspecific response to foreign invaders (pathogens) such as viruses and bacteria. In particular, the MDA5 protein recognizes a molecule called double-stranded RNA (a chemical cousin of DNA), which certain viruses, including rhinovirus (the virus that causes the common cold), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and the influenza (flu) virus, have as their genetic material or produce when they infect cells and copy (replicate) themselves. (Another subset of viruses has DNA as the genetic material.) When pieces of viral RNA are present inside a cell, multiple MDA5 proteins attach to it, one after another, forming a filament. Filament formation stimulates signals that turn on the production of immune system proteins called interferons. Interferons control the activity of genes that help block the viruses from replicating themselves and stimulate the activity of certain immune system cells to fight infection. Interferons also help regulate inflammation, which is another part of the body's innate immune response.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Aicardi-Goutières syndrome     At least 12 IFIH1 gene mutations have been found in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. This disorder is characterized by abnormalities of the immune system, skin, and brain, including calcium deposits in parts of the brain.The IFIH1 gene mutations involved in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome are described as \"gain-of-function\" because they lead to production of an MDA5 protein with enhanced activity. The altered protein may more readily attach to RNA, even pieces of RNA that are not from viruses, or to other MDA5 proteins to form filaments. Alternatively, filaments containing the altered protein may not be broken down when immune signaling is no longer needed. As a result of these changes, interferon production is abnormally turned on, leading to excessive immune system activity and inflammation.Constant inflammation is thought to disrupt the way calcium is handled in the body, leading to calcium deposits in people with Aicardi-Goutières syndrome. Excessive inflammation is also thought to damage cells in the brain and skin, leading to the abnormalities in these tissues characteristic of this disorder. More About This Health Condition      MDA5 deficiency     At least four genetic changes in the IFIH1 gene have been found to cause MDA5 deficiency, an immune system disorder (immunodeficiency) that leads to recurrent, severe viral infections in the lungs and airways (respiratory tract). Infections are most commonly caused by rhinovirus, RSV, and the flu virus. The changes in the IFIH1 gene that cause this condition are described as \"loss-of-function\" mutations because they lead to an altered version of the MDA5 protein that cannot function. Studies suggest that the altered protein is unable to attach to viral RNA or to other MDA5 proteins to form filaments. As a result, interferon production is not turned on. A lack of the important early immune response stimulated by interferons leads to severe viral infections in infants with MDA5 deficiency. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     IFIH1 gene mutations have also been found to cause Singleton-Merten syndrome. A feature of Singleton-Merten syndrome is calcium deposits in the large vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta) and in certain valves in the heart. Other signs and symptoms include tooth abnormalities, low bone density (osteopenia), and other bone problems. Some people with IFIH1 gene mutations have signs and symptoms of both Singleton-Merten syndrome and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (described above), suggesting that these two conditions may be part of a spectrum caused by IFIH1 gene mutations.As in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, the IFIH1 gene mutations involved in Singleton-Merten syndrome are described as \"gain-of-function\" and lead to excessive immune system activity and inflammation, disrupting calcium handling in the body. It is unclear why people with gain-of-function mutations in the IFIH1 gene develop signs and symptoms of one condition or the other.Singleton-Merten syndrome and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome both have autoimmune features, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and damages the body's own tissues and organs. Common variations (polymorphisms) in the IFIH1 gene have been associated with other autoimmune disorders. It is thought that polymorphisms that enhance the activity of the MDA5 protein increase the risk of certain autoimmune disorders, while polymorphisms that reduce the activity of the MDA5 protein help protect against others.

The changes in the IFIH1 gene that cause this condition are described as \"loss-of-function\" mutations because they lead to an altered version of the MDA5 protein that cannot function. Studies suggest that the altered protein is unable to attach to viral RNA or to other MDA5 proteins to form filaments. As a result, interferon production is not turned on. A lack of the important early immune response stimulated by interferons leads to severe viral infections in infants with MDA5 deficiency. More About This Health Condition  IFIH1 gene mutations have also been found to cause Singleton-Merten syndrome. A feature of Singleton-Merten syndrome is calcium deposits in the large vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body (the aorta) and in certain valves in the heart. Other signs and symptoms include tooth abnormalities, low bone density (osteopenia), and other bone problems. Some people with IFIH1 gene mutations have signs and symptoms of both Singleton-Merten syndrome and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (described above), suggesting that these two conditions may be part of a spectrum caused by IFIH1 gene mutations.As in Aicardi-Goutières syndrome, the IFIH1 gene mutations involved in Singleton-Merten syndrome are described as \"gain-of-function\" and lead to excessive immune system activity and inflammation, disrupting calcium handling in the body. It is unclear why people with gain-of-function mutations in the IFIH1 gene develop signs and symptoms of one condition or the other.Singleton-Merten syndrome and Aicardi-Goutières syndrome both have autoimmune features, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and damages the body's own tissues and organs. Common variations (polymorphisms) in the IFIH1 gene have been associated with other autoimmune disorders. It is thought that polymorphisms that enhance the activity of the MDA5 protein increase the risk of certain autoimmune disorders, while polymorphisms that reduce the activity of the MDA5 protein help protect against others.

Overlapping clinical features include retinal degeneration, renal cystic disease, skeletal abnormalities, fibrosis of various organ, and a complex range of anatomical and functional defects of the central and peripheral nervous system. The ciliopathy range of diseases includes Meckel-Gruber syndrome, Bardet-Biedl syndrome, Joubert syndrome, nephronophtisis, Senior-Loken syndrome, and Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy among others. TTC21B is causally associated with diverse ciliopathies. It also acts as a modifier gene across the ciliopathy spectrum, interacting in trans with mutations in other ciliopathy-causing genes and contributing to disease manifestation and severity.Joubert syndrome 11 (JBTS11): A disorder presenting with cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor apraxia, hypotonia, neonatal breathing abnormalities and psychomotor delay. Neuroradiologically, it is characterized by cerebellar vermian hypoplasia/aplasia, thickened and reoriented superior cerebellar peduncles, and an abnormally large interpeduncular fossa, giving the appearance of a molar tooth on transaxial slices (molar tooth sign). Additional variable features include retinal dystrophy and renal disease. [MIM:613820]Nephronophthisis 12 (NPHP12): An autosomal recessive disorder resulting in end-stage renal disease. It is a progressive tubulo-interstitial kidney disorder histologically characterized by modifications of the tubules with thickening of the basement membrane, interstitial fibrosis and, in the advanced stages, medullary cysts. Some patients manifest extra-renal features including retinal, skeletal and central nervous system defects.

            "LRP2\t   The LRP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called megalin, which functions as a receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function. Megalin has many ligands involved in various body processes, including the absorption of vitamins A and D, immune functioning, stress response, and the transport of fats in the bloodstream.Megalin is embedded in the membrane of cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body (epithelial cells). The receptor helps move its ligands from the cell surface into the cell (endocytosis), and is also involved in transporting the ligands of a related receptor called cubulin. Megalin is active in the development and function of many parts of the body, including the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), eyes, ears, lungs, intestine, reproductive system, and the small tubes in the kidneys where urine is formed (renal tubules).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Donnai-Barrow syndrome     At least twelve LRP2 gene mutations have been identified in people with Donnai-Barrow syndrome. These mutations are believed to result in the absence of functional megalin protein. The lack of functional megalin in the renal tubules causes megalin's various ligands to be excreted in the urine rather than being absorbed back into the bloodstream. The features of Donnai-Barrow syndrome are probably caused by the inability of megalin to help absorb these ligands, disruption of biochemical signaling pathways, or other effects of the nonfunctional megalin protein. However, it is unclear how these abnormalities result in the specific signs and symptoms of the disorder.A condition previously classified as a separate disorder called facio-oculo-acoustico-renal (FOAR) syndrome has also been found to be caused by LRP2 gene mutations. FOAR syndrome is now considered to be the same disorder as Donnai-Barrow syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Coloboma     Genetics Home Reference provides information about coloboma. More About This Health Condition      Prostate cancer     Genetics Home Reference provides information about prostate cancer. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     Certain common genetic variations (polymorphisms) in the LRP2 gene may be associated with differences in the progression, recurrence, and severity of prostate cancer in affected men. Androgens, which are male sex hormones that contribute to the growth of cancerous (malignant) prostate tumors, are among megalin's ligands. A recent study suggests that prostate tumor cells may produce increased amounts of megalin and thereby absorb more androgens. LRP2 gene polymorphisms that increase the activity of megalin may encourage more aggressive tumor growth, while polymorphisms that decrease the activity of megalin may tend to slow tumor growth.      Other disorders     Certain LRP2 gene polymorphisms have also been associated with increased levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) and cholesterol in the blood. LDLs are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood. Cholesterol is a waxy, fat-like substance that is produced in the body and obtained from foods that come from animals. Increased LDL levels may result in excess cholesterol circulating through the bloodstream and accumulating on the walls of the blood vessels, increasing a person's risk of cardiovascular disease.LDLs are among megalin's ligands, and researchers believe that variations in megalin function resulting from LRP2 gene changes may influence LDL levels.

            "ITGA6\t   The ITGA6 gene provides instructions for making one part (the α6 subunit) of two proteins known as α6β4 integrin and α6β1 integrin. Integrins are a group of proteins that regulate the attachment of cells to one another (cell-cell adhesion) and to the surrounding network of proteins and other molecules (cell-matrix adhesion). Integrins also transmit chemical signals that regulate cell growth and the activity of certain genes.The α6β4 integrin protein is found primarily in epithelial cells, which are cells that line the surfaces and cavities of the body. This protein plays a particularly important role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin. It is a component of hemidesmosomes, which are microscopic structures that anchor the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers. As part of a complex network of proteins in hemidesmosomes, α6β4 integrin helps to hold the layers of skin together.The other integrin made with the α6 subunit, α6β1 integrin, functions during the formation of organs and tissues before birth. The α6β1 integrin protein has not been as well studied as α6β4 integrin.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia     At least five mutations in the ITGA6 gene have been found to cause epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA). In addition to skin blistering, people with EB-PA are born with a life-threatening obstruction of the digestive tract called pyloric atresia. Mutations in the ITGA6 gene account for about 5 percent of all cases of EB-PA.The ITGA6 gene mutations responsible for EB-PA lead to a loss of functional α6β4 integrin. These mutations alter the normal structure and function of the α6 integrin subunit or prevent cells from producing enough of this subunit.  The resulting shortage of functional α6β4 integrin causes cells in the epidermis to be fragile and easily damaged. Friction or other minor trauma can cause the skin layers to separate, leading to the widespread formation of blisters. It is less clear how mutations in the ITGA6 gene are related to pyloric atresia. More About This Health Condition      Prostate cancer     Genetics Home Reference provides information about prostate cancer. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     Researchers believe that both α6β1 integrin and α6β4 integrin may play critical roles in the progression of cancerous tumors called carcinomas. These cancers arise in epithelial cells and can affect many tissues and organs, including the breast, lung, liver, prostate, and skin.Changes in the location and activity of α6β1 integrin and α6β4 integrin within cancer cells are associated with the progression of carcinomas. The integrin proteins activate key signaling molecules, which trigger cancer cells to migrate through the body and invade other tissues. These signals also make cancer cells more resistant to self-destruction (apoptosis).Recent studies suggest that, in addition to their roles in the progression of existing carcinomas, α6β1 integrin and α6β4 integrin may be involved in the initial formation of these tumors.

            "TTN\t   The TTN gene provides instructions for making a very large protein called titin. This protein plays an important role in muscles the body uses for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. Slightly different versions (called isoforms) of titin are made in different muscles.Within muscle cells, titin is an essential component of structures called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction; they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract. Titin has several functions within sarcomeres. One of the protein's main jobs is to provide structure, flexibility, and stability to these cell structures. Titin interacts with other muscle proteins, including actin and myosin, to keep the components of sarcomeres in place as muscles contract and relax. Titin also contains a spring-like region that allows muscles to stretch. Additionally, researchers have found that titin plays a role in chemical signaling and in assembling new sarcomeres.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Centronuclear myopathy     At least 12 mutations in the TTN gene have been found to cause centronuclear myopathy, a condition that is characterized by muscle weakness (myopathy) in the skeletal muscles. Most of these mutations alter the way the gene's instructions are used to produce titin, resulting in production of an abnormal protein with reduced or altered activity in muscle cells. Other mutations prevent the production of titin protein. It is unclear how TTN gene mutations cause centronuclear myopathy, but it is likely that a shortage of normal titin protein leads to dysfunction of the sarcomere. Abnormal sarcomeres prevent muscle cells from contracting and relaxing normally, resulting in the muscle weakness that is characteristic of centronuclear myopathy. More About This Health Condition      Early-onset myopathy with fatal cardiomyopathy     At least two mutations in the TTN gene have been identified in people with early-onset myopathy with fatal cardiomyopathy (EOMFC), an inherited disease that affects both skeletal and cardiac muscle. These genetic changes occur near the end of the TTN gene and lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the titin protein. The defective protein disrupts the function of sarcomeres, preventing skeletal and cardiac muscle from developing and working normally. These muscle abnormalities underlie the characteristic features of EOMFC, including skeletal muscle weakness and a form of heart disease called dilated cardiomyopathy. More About This Health Condition      Familial dilated cardiomyopathy     More than 100 mutations in the TTN gene have been found to cause familial dilated cardiomyopathy, a condition that weakens and enlarges the heart, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. Signs and symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy typically begin in mid-adulthood and result in heart failure. TTN gene mutations account for approximately one-quarter of all cases of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. These mutations result in the production of an abnormal titin protein, particularly isoforms that are found in cardiac muscle. It is unclear how the altered protein causes familial dilated cardiomyopathy, but it likely impairs sarcomere function and disrupts chemical signaling. Changes in sarcomere function reduce the heart's ability to contract, weakening cardiac muscle and leading to the signs and symptoms of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. More About This Health Condition      Hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure     Several mutations in the TTN gene have been found to cause hereditary myopathy with early respiratory failure (HMERF), an inherited disease that affects muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and muscles that are needed for breathing (respiratory muscles). These mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in a region of the TTN gene called exon 344. These changes alter a region of the titin protein called the FN3 119 domain and are thought to impair the folding of the titin protein into its normal 3-dimensional shape. Researchers are studying how abnormally folded titin contributes to the muscle damage underlying the signs and symptoms of HMERF. It is unclear why these effects are usually limited to certain skeletal muscles and respiratory muscles, and do not involve cardiac muscle. More About This Health Condition      Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy     At least two TTN gene mutations have been found to cause limb-girdle muscular dystrophy type 2J (LGMD2J). Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy is a group of related disorders characterized by weakness and wasting of skeletal muscles, particularly in the shoulders, hips, and limbs. LGMD2J is a type of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy that has been identified primarily in the Finnish population. The genetic change found in this population deletes several amino acids and replaces them with other amino acids at the end of the titin protein. This complex mutation, known as FINmaj, causes LGMD2J when it occurs in both copies of the TTN gene. The FINmaj mutation may disrupt titin's interactions with other proteins that are needed to maintain muscle fibers. Loss of muscle fibers causes muscles to weaken and waste away over time, resulting in the signs and symptoms of limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. More About This Health Condition      Tibial muscular dystrophy     Several mutations in the TTN gene have been identified in people with tibial muscular dystrophy, a condition that primarily affects the muscles at the front of the lower leg. The FINmaj mutation (described above) has been found to cause tibial muscular dystrophy in all affected people of Finnish descent. Other TTN gene mutations cause tibial muscular dystrophy in non-Finnish European populations. This condition is caused by mutations that occur in one copy of the TTN gene.Researchers predict that the TTN gene mutations responsible for tibial muscular dystrophy, including FINmaj, alter the ability of the titin protein to interact with other proteins within sarcomeres. These alterations likely impair  muscle fiber maintenance or muscle contraction, causing muscles to weaken and waste away over time. It is unclear why the resulting weakness is usually limited to muscles in the lower legs in tibial muscular dystrophy.Researchers are working to determine why some conditions resulting from TTN gene mutations predominantly affect cardiac muscle, some predominantly affect skeletal muscle, and some affect both. They suspect that these differences may be related to the location of mutations in the TTN gene and how they affect the many versions of titin that are produced in different muscles.

            "PIKFYVE\t   From NCBI Gene:Phosphorylated derivatives of phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) regulate cytoskeletal functions, membrane trafficking, and receptor signaling by recruiting protein complexes to cell- and endosomal-membranes. Humans have multiple PtdIns proteins that differ by the degree and position of phosphorylation of the inositol ring. This gene encodes an enzyme (PIKfyve; also known as phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate 5-kinase type III or PIPKIII) that phosphorylates the D-5 position in PtdIns and phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate (PtdIns3P) to make PtdIns5P and PtdIns(3,5)biphosphate. The D-5 position also can be phosphorylated by type I PtdIns4P-5-kinases (PIP5Ks) that are encoded by distinct genes and preferentially phosphorylate D-4 phosphorylated PtdIns. In contrast, PIKfyve preferentially phosphorylates D-3 phosphorylated PtdIns. In addition to being a lipid kinase, PIKfyve also has protein kinase activity. PIKfyve regulates endomembrane homeostasis and plays a role in the biogenesis of endosome carrier vesicles from early endosomes. Mutations in this gene cause corneal fleck dystrophy (CFD); an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by numerous small white flecks present in all layers of the corneal stroma.

            "CPS1\t   The CPS1 gene provides instructions for making the enzyme carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I. This enzyme participates in the urea cycle, a series of reactions that occurs in liver cells. The urea cycle processes excess nitrogen, generated when protein is used by the body, into a compound called urea that is excreted by the kidneys. Excreting the excess nitrogen prevents it from accumulating in the form of ammonia, which is toxic.The specific role of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I is to control the first step of the urea cycle, a reaction in which excess nitrogen compounds are incorporated into the cycle to be processed.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency     Approximately 10 mutations that cause carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency have been identified in the CPS1 gene. A mutated CPS1 gene may result in a carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I enzyme that is shorter than normal or the wrong shape, or may prevent the enzyme from being produced at all.The shape of an enzyme affects its ability to control a chemical reaction. If the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase enzyme is misshapen or missing, it cannot fulfill its role in the urea cycle. Excess nitrogen is not converted to urea for excretion, and ammonia accumulates in the body. Ammonia is toxic, especially to the nervous system, so this accumulation causes neurological problems and other signs and symptoms of carbamoyl phosphate synthetase I deficiency. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     One common alteration (polymorphism) in the CPS1 gene has been associated with increased risk of circulatory problems in newborns and in individuals who have received bone marrow transplants. This genetic change results in the amino acid (protein building block) asparagine being substituted for the amino acid threonine at position 1405 in the protein sequence (written as Thr1405Asn or T1405N).Researchers believe that this polymorphism in the CPS1 gene may reduce the production of a compound called nitric oxide (NO). Normally, nitric oxide causes blood vessels to expand (dilate), which reduces blood pressure. A reduced amount of nitric oxide could lead to circulatory problems.

            "ERBB4\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene is a member of the Tyr protein kinase family and the epidermal growth factor receptor subfamily. It encodes a single-pass type I membrane protein with multiple cysteine rich domains, a transmembrane domain, a tyrosine kinase domain, a phosphotidylinositol-3 kinase binding site and a PDZ domain binding motif. The protein binds to and is activated by neuregulins and other factors and induces a variety of cellular responses including mitogenesis and differentiation. Multiple proteolytic events allow for the release of a cytoplasmic fragment and an extracellular fragment. Mutations in this gene have been associated with cancer. Alternatively spliced variants which encode different protein isoforms have been described; however, not all variants have been fully characterized. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Tyrosine-protein kinase that plays an essential role as cell surface receptor for neuregulins and EGF family members and regulates development of the heart, the central nervous system and the mammary gland, gene transcription, cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis. Required for normal cardiac muscle differentiation during embryonic development, and for postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation. Required for normal development of the embryonic central nervous system, especially for normal neural crest cell migration and normal axon guidance. Required for mammary gland differentiation, induction of milk proteins and lactation. Acts as cell-surface receptor for the neuregulins NRG1, NRG2, NRG3 and NRG4 and the EGF family members BTC, EREG and HBEGF. Ligand binding triggers receptor dimerization and autophosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues that then serve as binding sites for scaffold proteins and effectors. Ligand specificity and signaling is modulated by alternative splicing, proteolytic processing, and by the formation of heterodimers with other ERBB family members, thereby creating multiple combinations of intracellular phosphotyrosines that trigger ligand- and context-specific cellular responses. Mediates phosphorylation of SHC1 and activation of the MAP kinases MAPK1/ERK2 and MAPK3/ERK1. Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-1 phosphorylate PIK3R1, leading to the activation of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and AKT1 and protect cells against apoptosis. Isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-B CYT-1 mediate reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and promote cell migration in response to NRG1. Isoform JM-A CYT-2 and isoform JM-B CYT-2 lack the phosphotyrosine that mediates interaction with PIK3R1, and hence do not phosphorylate PIK3R1, do not protect cells against apoptosis, and do not promote reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton and cell migration. Proteolytic processing of isoform JM-A CYT-1 and isoform JM-A CYT-2 gives rise to the corresponding soluble intracellular domains (4ICD) that translocate to the nucleus, promote nuclear import of STAT5A, activation of STAT5A, mammary epithelium differentiation, cell proliferation and activation of gene expression. The ERBB4 soluble intracellular domains (4ICD) colocalize with STAT5A at the CSN2 promoter to regulate transcription of milk proteins during lactation. The ERBB4 soluble intracellular domains can also translocate to mitochondria and promote apoptosis.

            "APOB\t   The APOB gene provides instructions for making two versions of the apolipoprotein B protein, a short version called apolipoprotein B-48 and a longer version known as apolipoprotein B-100. Both of these proteins are components of lipoproteins, which are particles that carry fats and fat-like substances (such as cholesterol) in the blood.Apolipoprotein B-48 is produced in the intestine, where it is a building block of a type of lipoprotein called a chylomicron. As food is digested after a meal, chylomicrons are formed to carry fat and cholesterol from the intestine into the bloodstream.  Chylomicrons are also necessary for the absorption of certain fat-soluble vitamins such as vitamin E and vitamin A.Apolipoprotein B-100, which is produced in the liver, is a component of several other types of lipoproteins. Specifically, this protein is a building block of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDLs), intermediate-density lipoproteins (IDLs), and low-density lipoproteins (LDLs). These related molecules all transport fats and cholesterol in the bloodstream.Low-density lipoproteins are the primary carriers of cholesterol in the blood.  Apolipoprotein B-100 allows these particles to attach to specific receptors on the surface of cells, particularly in the liver. The receptors transport low-density lipoproteins into the cell, where they are broken down to release cholesterol. The cholesterol is then used by the cell, stored, or removed from the body.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Familial hypobetalipoproteinemia     More than 90 mutations in the APOB gene have been found to cause familial hypobetalipoproteinemia (FHBL), a disorder that impairs the body's ability to absorb and transport fat. Most APOB gene mutations that cause FHBL lead to the production of apolipoprotein B that is abnormally short.The severity of the condition largely depends on the length of the abnormal apolipoprotein B. Some mutations in the APOB gene lead to the production of a protein that is shorter than apolipoprotein B-100, but longer than apolipoprotein B-48. In these cases, normal apolipoprotein B-48 is still made in the intestine. The normal-length apolipoprotein B-48 can form chylomicrons normally, but the abnormally short apolipoprotein B-100 produced in the liver is less able to produce lipoproteins. Other mutations result in a protein that is shorter than both apolipoprotein B-48 and apolipoprotein B-100. In these cases, no normal-length apolipoprotein B protein is produced. The severely shortened protein is not able to form lipoproteins in the liver or the intestine. Generally, if both versions of the protein are shorter than apolipoprotein B-48, the signs and symptoms are more severe than if some normal length apolipoprotein B-48 is produced. All of these protein changes lead to a reduction of functional apolipoprotein B. As a result, the transportation of dietary fats and cholesterol is decreased or absent. A decrease in fat transport reduces the body's ability to absorb fats and fat-soluble vitamins from the diet, leading to the signs and symptoms of FHBL. More About This Health Condition      Hypercholesterolemia     At least five mutations in the APOB gene are known to cause a form of inherited hypercholesterolemia called familial defective apolipoprotein B-100 (FDB). This condition is characterized by very high levels of cholesterol in the blood and an increased risk of developing heart disease. Each mutation that causes this condition changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical region of apolipoprotein B-100. The altered protein prevents low-density lipoproteins from effectively binding to their receptors on the surface of cells. As a result, fewer low-density lipoproteins are removed from the blood, and cholesterol levels are much higher than normal.  As the excess cholesterol circulates through the bloodstream, it is deposited abnormally in tissues such as the skin, tendons, and arteries that supply blood to the heart (coronary arteries).  A buildup of cholesterol in the walls of coronary arteries greatly increases a person's risk of having a heart attack. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Researchers are studying other variations (polymorphisms) in the APOB gene that may influence heart disease risk in people without inherited cholesterol disorders.  Some studies have found that certain polymorphisms are associated with higher levels of low-density lipoproteins in the blood and an increased chance of developing or dying of heart disease. Other studies, however, have not shown such an association.  It is clear that a large number of genetic and lifestyle factors, many of which remain unknown, determine the risk of developing this complex condition.

            "BARD1\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a protein which interacts with the N-terminal region of BRCA1. In addition to its ability to bind BRCA1 in vivo and in vitro, it shares homology with the 2 most conserved regions of BRCA1: the N-terminal RING motif and the C-terminal BRCT domain. The RING motif is a cysteine-rich sequence found in a variety of proteins that regulate cell growth, including the products of tumor suppressor genes and dominant protooncogenes. This protein also contains 3 tandem ankyrin repeats. The BARD1/BRCA1 interaction is disrupted by tumorigenic amino acid substitutions in BRCA1, implying that the formation of a stable complex between these proteins may be an essential aspect of BRCA1 tumor suppression. This protein may be the target of oncogenic mutations in breast or ovarian cancer. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2013]From UniProt:E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase. The BRCA1-BARD1 heterodimer specifically mediates the formation of 'Lys-6'-linked polyubiquitin chains and coordinates a diverse range of cellular pathways such as DNA damage repair, ubiquitination and transcriptional regulation to maintain genomic stability. Plays a central role in the control of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage. Acts by mediating ubiquitin E3 ligase activity that is required for its tumor suppressor function. Also forms a heterodimer with CSTF1/CSTF-50 to modulate mRNA processing and RNAP II stability by inhibiting pre-mRNA 3' cleavage.

            "ABCA12\t   The ABCA12 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter.  ABC transporter proteins carry many types of molecules across cell membranes.  In particular, the ABCA12 protein plays a major role in transporting fats (lipids) in cells that make up the outermost layer of skin (the epidermis). This lipid transport is needed to maintain the layers of lipids within the epidermis that are necessary to prevent water loss (dehydration) and for normal development of the skin. The ABCA12 protein is also found in several other tissues, including the testes, placenta, lungs, stomach, fetal brain, and liver.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Harlequin ichthyosis     More than 65 mutations in the ABCA12 gene have been identified in people with harlequin ichthyosis. This skin condition is characterized by hard, thick scales that are present at birth; excessive dehydration; and increased risk of infections. Most of the mutations lead to an absence of ABCA12 protein or the production of an extremely small version of the protein that cannot transport lipids properly. A lack of lipid transport causes numerous problems with the development of the epidermis before and after birth. Specifically, it prevents the skin from forming an effective barrier against dehydration, and leads to the skin problems characteristic of harlequin ichthyosis. More About This Health Condition      Nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma     At least 20 mutations in the ABCA12 gene have been found to cause nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (NBCIE). This condition affects the skin and causes redness; the development of fine, white scales; an increased risk of infections; and dehydration. These skin abnormalities tend to be less severe than those in harlequin ichthyosis (described above). Most of the mutations that cause NBCIE change single amino acids in the ABCA12 protein. These mutations likely lead to the production of a protein with reduced function, which impairs lipid transport and the formation of the lipid layers within the epidermis. Problems with this protective barrier underlie the skin abnormalities and other features of NBCIE.

            "FN1\t   The FN1 gene provides instructions for making two types of the fibronectin-1 protein: soluble plasma fibronectin-1 and insoluble cellular fibronectin-1. Liver cells produce soluble plasma fibronectin-1 and release it into the bloodstream, where it is mainly involved in blood clotting and wound healing. Soluble plasma fibronectin-1 functions outside of cells (in the extracellular spaces), attaching (binding) to the surface of cells and binding to proteins, including other fibronectin-1 proteins. The attachment of these proteins form fibers that assist with tissue repair after an injury. Fibronectin-1 binding also helps with the continual formation of the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice of proteins and other molecules that is made in the spaces between cells. This matrix provides structure and strength to tissues that support the body's organs. Many other cell types produce insoluble cellular fibronectin-1, which is released into the extracellular space and contributes to the creation of fibers and extracellular matrix. Both types of fibronectin-1 help individual cells expand (spread) and move (migrate) to cover more space and also influence cell shape and maturation (differentiation).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Fibronectin glomerulopathy     At least three mutations in the FN1 gene have been found to cause fibronectin glomerulopathy, a progressive kidney disease that usually begins in adulthood and results in irreversible kidney failure (end-stage renal disease). FN1 gene mutations account for about 40 percent of cases of fibronectin glomerulopathy. The FN1 gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the fibronectin-1 protein. One mutation that occurs in multiple families replaces the amino acid tyrosine with the amino acid cysteine at position 973 in the fibronectin-1 protein (written as Tyr973Cys or Y973C). FN1 gene mutations impair the protein's ability to bind to cells and proteins. The unbound fibronectin-1 protein, specifically soluble plasma fibronectin-1, is deposited in the glomeruli of the kidneys. These structures are clusters of tiny blood vessels in the kidneys that filter waste products from blood, which are then released in urine. Even though there is an abundance of fibronectin-1 in the glomeruli, the extracellular matrix that supports the blood vessels is weak because the altered fibronectin-1 cannot assist in the matrix's continual formation. Without a strong cellular support network, the glomeruli are less able to filter waste. As a result, products that normally are retained by the body, such as protein and blood, get released in the urine, and acids are not properly filtered from the blood. Over time, the kidneys' ability to filter waste decreases until the kidneys can no longer function, resulting in end-stage renal disease.

            "OBSL1\t   The OBSL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is thought to help maintain normal levels of another protein called cullin-7, which is produced from the CUL7 gene. The cullin-7 protein plays a role in the ubiquitin-proteasome system, which is the cell machinery that breaks down (degrades) unwanted proteins.Cullin-7 helps assemble a complex known as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. This complex tags damaged and excess proteins with molecules called ubiquitin. Ubiquitin serves as a signal to specialized cell structures known as proteasomes, which attach (bind) to the tagged proteins and degrade them. The ubiquitin-proteasome system acts as the cell's quality control system by disposing of damaged, misshapen, and excess proteins. This system also regulates the level of proteins involved in several critical cell activities such as the timing of cell division and growth. In particular, the OBSL1 protein and cullin-7 are thought to help regulate proteins involved in the body's response to growth hormones, although their specific role in this process is unknown.

Most of these mutations substitute one protein building block (amino acid) for another amino acid in the OBSL1 protein or result in an OBSL1 protein that is abnormally short and nonfunctional.Mutations in the OBSL1 gene likely lead to reduced cullin-7 protein levels, preventing cullin-7 from bringing together the components of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and interfering with the process of tagging unneeded proteins for degradation.

            "COL4A3\t   The COL4A3 gene provides instructions for making one component of type IV collagen, which is a flexible protein. Specifically, this gene makes the alpha3(IV) chain of type IV collagen. This chain combines with two other types of alpha (IV) chains (the alpha4 and alpha5 chains) to make a complete type IV collagen molecule. Type IV collagen molecules attach to each other to form complex protein networks. These networks make up a large portion of basement membranes, which are thin sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. Type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 networks play an especially important role in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Alport syndrome     More than 40 mutations in the COL4A3 gene have been found to cause Alport syndrome. Most of these mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in a region where the alpha3(IV) collagen chain combines with other type IV collagen chains. Other mutations in the COL4A3 gene severely decrease or prevent the production of alpha3(IV) chains. As a result, there is a serious deficiency of the type IV collagen alpha3-4-5 network in the basement membranes of the kidney, inner ear, and eye. In the kidney, other types of collagen accumulate in the basement membranes, eventually leading to scarring of the kidneys and kidney failure. Mutations in this gene can also lead to abnormal function in the inner ear, resulting in hearing loss.

This condition typically causes people to have blood in their urine (hematuria) but no other signs or symptoms of kidney disease. In the past, this condition was often called benign familial hematuria. Thin basement membrane nephropathy rarely progresses to kidney failure.Goodpasture syndrome is a severe disease of the lungs and the kidneys caused by antibodies to the alpha3(IV) collagen chains. Antibodies are immune system proteins that normally attack foreign substances such as bacteria or viruses, but in Goodpasture syndrome, they target alpha3(IV) collagen chains. It remains unclear why some people make antibodies to their own collagen chains. The antibodies cause inflammation when they attach (bind) to the basement membranes of blood vessels in the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs and filtering units (glomeruli) of the kidneys. As a result, people with Goodpasture syndrome can develop kidney failure and bleeding in the lungs, which causes them to cough up blood. In some people, antibodies attack only the kidneys.

            "COL6A3\t   The COL6A3 gene provides instructions for making one component of type VI collagen, which is a flexible protein found in the space that surrounds cells. Specifically, the protein produced from the COL6A3 gene is the alpha(α)3(VI) chain of type VI collagen. This chain combines with chains produced from other genes to produce a complete type VI collagen molecule.Collagens are found in the extracellular matrix, which is an intricate lattice that forms in the space between cells and provides structural support. Type VI collagen is located in the extracellular matrix surrounding cells that make up the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscle cells) and cells that make up connective tissue, which provides strength and flexibility to structures throughout the body, including skin and joints. The extracellular matrix is necessary for cell stability and growth. Research suggests that type VI collagen links basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that are part of the extracellular matrix, to nearby cells.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Collagen VI-related myopathy     Mutations in the COL6A3 gene have been found to cause some cases of collagen VI-related myopathy, which is a group of disorders that vary in severity but generally result in muscle weakness and joint deformities called contractures. These mutations often change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the α3(VI) chain. The most frequently affected amino acid is glycine; changes to this building block disrupt the structure of the α3(VI) chain. Other mutations can also disrupt the structure of the α3(VI) chain.Mutations in the COL6A3 gene affect type VI collagen in different ways. Some mutations lead to altered α3(VI) chains that can be incorporated into the mature type VI collagen molecule, although they disrupt the molecule's structure and function. Other mutations result in an altered chain that cannot be incorporated at all. Still other mutations prevent the production of any functional α3(VI) chain, which impedes formation of type VI collagen. All of these COL6A3 gene mutations lead to a reduction or absence of functional collagen VI molecules. While it is difficult to predict the severity of collagen VI-related myopathy based on the type of mutation, in general, lower amounts of type VI collagen lead to more severe signs and symptoms that begin earlier in life.Changes in α3(VI) chain structure or production lead to an unstable extracellular matrix that is no longer attached to cells through the basement membrane. As a result, the stability of muscle cells and connective tissue progressively declines, which leads to the muscle weakness, contractures, and other signs and symptoms of collagen VI-related myopathy.

            "AGXT\t   The AGXT gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called serine-pyruvate aminotransferase. This enzyme is found in liver cells, specifically within cell structures called peroxisomes. These structures are important for several cellular activities, such as ridding the cell of toxic substances and helping to break down certain fats. In the peroxisome, serine-pyruvate aminotransferase converts a compound called glyoxylate to the protein building block (amino acid) glycine.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Primary hyperoxaluria     More than 175 mutations in the AGXT gene have been found to cause primary hyperoxaluria type 1. This condition is caused by the overproduction of a substance called oxalate. Excess amounts of this substance lead to kidney and bladder stones, which can begin anytime from childhood to early adulthood with kidney disease developing at any age. Deposition of oxalate in multiple other tissues throughout the body (systemic oxalosis) can cause additional health problems.Most of the AGXT gene mutations decrease or eliminate serine-pyruvate aminotransferase activity, which impairs the conversion of glyoxylate to glycine. Other mutations cause the enzyme to be misplaced in cells, transporting it to structures called mitochondria instead of to peroxisomes. While the enzyme in the mitochondria retains activity, it cannot access glyoxylate, which is in peroxisomes. All AGXT gene mutations result in the accumulation of glyoxylate, which is converted to oxalate instead of glycine. The oxalate is filtered through the kidneys and is either excreted in urine as a waste product or combines with calcium to form calcium oxalate, a hard compound that is the main component of kidney and bladder stones. Increased oxalate levels in the blood can lead to systemic oxalosis, particularly affecting bones and the walls of blood vessels in people with primary hyperoxaluria type 1.

            "HADHA\t   The HADHA gene provides instructions for making part of an enzyme complex called mitochondrial trifunctional protein. This enzyme complex functions in mitochondria, the energy-producing centers within cells. Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is made of eight parts (subunits). Four alpha subunits are produced from the HADHA gene, and four beta subunits are produced from the HADHB gene. As the name suggests, mitochondrial trifunctional protein contains three enzymes that each perform a different function. The alpha subunits contain two of the enzymes, known as long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and long-chain 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase. The beta subunits contain the third enzyme. These enzymes are essential for fatty acid oxidation, which is the multistep process that breaks down (metabolizes) fats and converts them to energy.Mitochondrial trifunctional protein is required to metabolize a group of fats called long-chain fatty acids. Long-chain fatty acids are found in foods such as milk and certain oils. These fatty acids are stored in the body's fat tissues. Fatty acids are a major source of energy for the heart and muscles. During periods of fasting, fatty acids are also an important energy source for the liver and other tissues.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency     Researchers have identified several HADHA gene mutations that cause long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (LCHAD) deficiency. These mutations decrease the long-chain 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase enzyme activity of mitochondrial trifunctional protein.  (The protein's other enzyme activities remain normal or nearly normal.)  Many of the HADHA mutations change one of the protein building blocks (amino acids) used to make the alpha subunit.  The most common mutation replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid glutamine at position 474 in the alpha subunit.  This mutation is written as Glu474Gln or E474Q.  The Glu474Gln mutation and other amino acid replacements probably alter the structure of the alpha subunit, preventing it from functioning normally.  Other HADHA mutations result in an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the alpha subunit.With a shortage (deficiency) of functional alpha subunits, long-chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized and processed.  As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of LCHAD deficiency, such as lack of energy (lethargy) and low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). Long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may also build up and damage the liver, heart, muscles, and light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (retina). This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of LCHAD deficiency. More About This Health Condition      Mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency     Researchers have identified several HADHA gene mutations that cause mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency. These mutations reduce all three enzyme activities of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. Some of these mutations result in abnormally short, nonfunctional alpha subunits and lead to decreased levels of mitochondrial trifunctional protein. Other mutations replace one amino acid with another amino acid in the alpha subunit, which probably alters the subunit's structure and disrupts all three functions of the enzyme complex.When mitochondrial trifunctional protein activity is lost, long-chain fatty acids cannot be metabolized and processed. As a result, these fatty acids are not converted to energy, which can lead to some features of this disorder, such as lethargy and hypoglycemia. Long-chain fatty acids or partially metabolized fatty acids may build up in tissues and damage the liver, heart, and muscles. This abnormal buildup causes the other signs and symptoms of mitochondrial trifunctional protein deficiency. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     In a small number of cases, HADHA mutations appear to increase a woman's risk of developing two serious liver disorders during pregnancy, known as acute fatty liver of pregnancy (AFLP) and HELLP syndrome. AFLP begins with abdominal pain and can rapidly progress to liver failure. HELLP stands for hemolysis (the breakdown of red blood cells), elevated liver enzyme levels, and low platelets (cell fragments involved with blood clotting).A woman is more likely to have AFLP or HELLP syndrome if she has a mutation in one copy of the HADHA gene and the fetus she carries has two copies of a HADHA mutation, particularly the Glu474Gln mutation.  Little is known about the relationship between HADHA mutations and liver problems in the mother during pregnancy.  One possibility is that partially metabolized long-chain fatty acids produced by the fetus or placenta accumulate in the mother and are toxic to her liver.  In very rare cases of maternal liver disease, the mother has one copy of an altered HADHA gene and the fetus is not affected.  In these cases, the role of the mother's HADHA mutation in liver disease is unclear.

            "CYP1B1\t   The CYP1B1 gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme that is a member of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. These enzymes are involved in many processes in the body, such as assisting with reactions that break down drugs and produce certain fats (lipids). The CYP1B1 enzyme participates in biochemical reactions in which an oxygen atom is added to other molecules.The CYP1B1 enzyme is active in many tissues, including structures of the eye. The function of the CYP1B1 enzyme in the development of the eye is unclear, but it may play a role in forming structures at the front of the eye and may also be involved in a process that regulates the secretion of fluid inside the eye.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Early-onset glaucoma     More than 140 CYP1B1 gene mutations have been identified to cause early-onset glaucoma. People with this condition experience increased pressure within the eye before the age of 40. This pressure causes damage to the optic nerves connecting the eyes and the brain. Between 20 percent and 40 percent of people with glaucoma before the age of 5 (primary congenital glaucoma) have mutations in the CYP1B1 gene. The mutations that cause early-onset glaucoma may result in an enzyme that is unstable or the wrong shape.It is not well understood how defects in the CYP1B1 enzyme cause signs and symptoms of glaucoma. Recent studies suggest that the defects may interfere with the early development of the trabecular meshwork, which is a network of mesh-like canals that helps drain excess fluid from the eye. If fluid cannot be drained, pressure inside the eye may increase, which is characteristic of glaucoma.The CYP1B1 enzyme may interact with another protein called myocilin, which is produced from the MYOC gene. Individuals with mutations in both the MYOC and CYP1B1 genes may develop glaucoma at an earlier age and have more severe symptoms than do those with mutations in only one of the genes. More About This Health Condition      Peters anomaly     A few mutations in the CYP1B1 gene have been found to cause Peters anomaly. This condition is characterized by abnormal development of certain structures at the front of the eye and clouding of the clear front surface of the eye (cornea). The mutations that cause Peters anomaly likely impair the normal function of the CYP1B1 enzyme or disrupt enzyme production. As a result, there is a shortage (deficiency) of normal enzyme. A lack of the CYP1B1 enzyme likely disrupts normal development of the eye, although it is unclear exactly how this deficiency leads to the features of Peters anomaly.

            "ATP6V1B1\t   The ATP6V1B1 gene provides instructions for making a part (subunit) of a large protein complex known as vacuolar H+-ATPase (V-ATPase). V-ATPases are a group of similar complexes that act as pumps to move positively charged hydrogen atoms (protons) across membranes. Because acids are substances that can \"donate\" protons to other molecules, this movement of protons helps regulate the relative acidity (pH) of cells and their surrounding environment. Tight control of pH is necessary for most biological reactions to proceed properly.The V-ATPase that includes the subunit produced from the ATP6V1B1 gene is found in the inner ear and in nephrons, which are the functional structures within the kidneys. The kidneys filter waste products from the blood and remove them in urine. They also reabsorb needed nutrients and release them back into the blood. Each nephron consists of two parts: a renal corpuscle (also known as a glomerulus) that filters the blood, and a renal tubule that reabsorbs substances that are needed and eliminates unneeded substances in urine. The V-ATPase is involved in regulating the amount of acid that is removed from the blood into the urine, and also in maintaining the proper pH of the fluid in the inner ear (endolymph).

As a result, the kidneys are less able to control the acidity of the blood, which leads to bone weakness caused by loss of bone minerals (demineralization) and other consequences of metabolic acidosis.

            "ALMS1\t   The ALMS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unknown. Researchers believe that the protein may play a role in hearing, vision, regulation of body weight, and functions of the heart, kidney, lungs, and liver. It may also affect how the pancreas regulates insulin, a hormone that helps control blood sugar levels.The ALMS1 protein is present in most of the body's tissues, usually at low levels. Within cells, this protein is located in structures called centrosomes. Centrosomes play a role in cell division and the assembly of microtubules, which are proteins that transport materials in cells and help the cell maintain its shape. The ALMS1 protein is also found at the base of cilia, which are finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells.  Almost all cells have cilia at some stage of their life cycle.  Cilia are involved in cell movement and many different chemical signaling pathways. Based on its location within cells, researchers suggest that the ALMS1 protein might be involved in the organization of microtubules, the transport of various materials, and the normal function of cilia.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Alström syndrome     More than 80 mutations in the ALMS1 gene have been identified in people with Alström syndrome. Most of these mutations lead to the production of an abnormally small version of the ALMS1 protein that does not function properly. Researchers propose that a lack of normally functioning ALMS1 protein in the brain could lead to overeating. A loss of this protein in the pancreas may cause insulin resistance, a condition in which the body cannot use insulin properly. The combined effects of overeating and insulin resistance impair the body's ability to handle excess sugar, leading to diabetes and obesity (two common features of Alström syndrome). It is unclear how ALMS1 mutations cause the other signs and symptoms of Alström syndrome.  Researchers suspect that this condition is associated with malfunctioning cilia in many of the body's tissues and organs.

            "SYN2\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene is a member of the synapsin gene family. Synapsins encode neuronal phosphoproteins which associate with the cytoplasmic surface of synaptic vesicles. Family members are characterized by common protein domains, and they are implicated in synaptogenesis and the modulation of neurotransmitter release, suggesting a potential role in several neuropsychiatric diseases. This member of the synapsin family encodes a neuron-specific phosphoprotein that selectively binds to small synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic nerve terminal. Polymorphisms in this gene are associated with abnormal presynaptic function and related neuronal disorders, including autism, epilepsy, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. The tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 4 gene is located within an intron of this gene and is transcribed in the opposite direction.

            "SI\t   The SI gene provides instructions for producing the enzyme sucrase-isomaltase.  This enzyme is found in the intestinal tract, where it is involved in breaking down the sugars sucrose (a sugar found in fruits, and also known as table sugar) and maltose (the sugar found in grains).  Sucrose and maltose are called disaccharides because they are each made up of two simple sugar molecules.   Disaccharides must be broken down into simple sugar molecules to be digested properly.The sucrase-isomaltase enzyme is found on the surface of the intestinal epithelial cells, which are cells that line the walls of the intestine. These cells have fingerlike projections called microvilli that absorb nutrients from food as it passes through the intestine. Based on their appearance, groups of these microvilli are known collectively as the brush border.  The role of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme is to break down sucrose and maltose into simple sugars so that they can be absorbed by microvilli into intestinal epithelial cells.

These mutations disrupt the folding and processing of the sucrose-isomaltase enzyme, transportation of the enzyme within the intestinal epithelial cells, the orientation of the enzyme to the cell surface, or its normal functioning.  An impairment in any of these cell processes results in a sucrase-isomaltase enzyme that cannot effectively break down sucrose, maltose, or other compounds made from these sugar molecules (carbohydrates).

This condition is apparent at birth or early childhood and is characterized by neurological decline, scaly skin (ichthyosis), and skeletal abnormalities. Most SUMF1 gene mutations that cause multiple sulfatase deficiency change single amino acids in the FGE enzyme. These changes severely reduce enzyme function or produce an unstable enzyme that is quickly broken down. The activity of multiple sulfatases is impaired because the FGE enzyme modifies all known sulfatase enzymes. Sulfate-containing molecules that are not broken down build up in cells, often resulting in cell death. The death of cells in particular tissues, specifically the brain, skeleton, and skin, cause many of the signs and symptoms of multiple sulfatase deficiency.

            "NBEAL2\t   The NBEAL2 gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. The protein appears to be critical for the normal development of platelets, which are blood cell fragments involved in blood clotting.Platelets are produced in bone marrow, the spongy tissue in the center of long bones that produces most of the blood cells the body needs. Platelets are formed from large precursor cells known as megakaryocytes. Within these cells, the NBEAL2 protein is thought to play a role in the development of sacs called alpha-granules, which are the most abundant components of platelets. Alpha-granules contain growth factors and other proteins that are important for blood clotting and wound healing. In response to an injury that causes bleeding, the proteins stored in alpha-granules help platelets stick to one another to form a plug that seals off damaged blood vessels and prevents further blood loss.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Gray platelet syndrome     At least 35 mutations in the NBEAL2 gene have been found to cause gray platelet syndrome, a disorder associated with abnormal bleeding. Most people with gray platelet syndrome also develop a condition called myelofibrosis, which is characterized by the buildup of scar tissue (fibrosis) in the bone marrow that prevents it from making enough normal blood cells.Mutations in the NBEAL2 gene disrupt the normal production of alpha-granules in megakaryocytes. Without alpha-granules, platelets are abnormally large and fewer in number than usual (macrothrombocytopenia). The abnormal platelets also appear gray when viewed under a microscope, which gives this condition its name. A lack of alpha-granules impairs the clumping of platelets in response to injury, increasing the risk of abnormal bleeding. Myelofibrosis is thought to occur because the growth factors and other proteins that are normally packaged into alpha-granules leak out into the bone marrow. The proteins lead to fibrosis that affects the bone marrow's ability to make new blood cells.

            "COL7A1\t   The COL7A1 gene provides instructions for making proteins that are used to assemble type VII collagen.  Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues, such as skin, bone, tendons, and ligaments, throughout the body.  In particular, type VII collagen plays an essential role in strengthening and stabilizing the skin.The proteins produced from the COL7A1 gene, called pro-α1(VII) chains, are the components of type VII collagen. Three pro-α1(VII) chains twist together to form a triple-stranded, ropelike molecule known as a procollagen. Procollagen molecules are secreted by the cell and processed by enzymes to remove extra protein segments from the ends. Once these molecules are processed, they arrange themselves into long, thin bundles of mature type VII collagen.Type VII collagen is the major component of structures in the skin called anchoring fibrils.  These fibrils are found in a region known as the epidermal basement membrane zone, which is a two-layer membrane located between the top layer of skin, called the epidermis, and an underlying layer called the dermis.  Anchoring fibrils hold the two layers of skin together by connecting the epidermal basement membrane to the dermis.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa     More than 400 mutations in the COL7A1 gene have been identified in people with dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.  These mutations alter the structure or disrupt the production of type VII collagen, which impairs the ability of anchoring fibrils to connect the epidermis to the dermis.  When type VII collagen is abnormal or missing, anchoring fibrils cannot form properly.  As a result, friction or other minor trauma can cause the two skin layers to separate.  This separation leads to the formation of blisters, which can result in extensive scarring as they heal.The autosomal recessive types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB) result from mutations in both copies of the COL7A1 gene in each cell.  The most severe, classic form of this disorder is known as the Hallopeau-Siemens type (RDEB-HS).  Most of the COL7A1 mutations responsible for RDEB-HS significantly reduce or eliminate the production of type VII collagen.  As a result, few or no anchoring fibrils are present to connect the epidermis with the dermis.  This lack of anchoring fibrils causes the severe signs and symptoms of RDEB-HS.  A somewhat less severe form of autosomal recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, known as the non-Hallopeau-Siemens type (Non-HS RDEB), is caused by other types of mutations.  These genetic changes allow a small amount of normal or partially functional type VII collagen to be produced.A milder, autosomal dominant form of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DDEB) results from mutations in one copy of the COL7A1 gene in each cell.  In many cases, these mutations occur in a part of type VII collagen known as the collagenous region.  This region gives type VII collagen its usual triple-stranded structure.  It is made up of a pattern of protein building blocks (amino acids) in which every third amino acid is a glycine.  Mutations that substitute other amino acids for glycine in this region can disrupt the triple-stranded structure of type VII collagen.  When the abnormally shaped collagen molecules are incorporated into anchoring fibrils, they interfere with the fibrils' normal function and prevent them from effectively connecting the epidermis and the dermis.  DDEB can also be caused by other types of mutations, particularly changes that affect the folding of type VII collagen.It is unclear how COL7A1 mutations are associated with an increased risk of certain cancers, particularly squamous cell carcinoma, in people with severe types of dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa.  Some research has suggested that abnormal forms of type VII collagen that retain a fragment called the NC1 domain may increase the risk of tumor formation.  Other studies, however, have not found this association.

            "GPX1\t   From NCBI Gene:The protein encoded by this gene belongs to the glutathione peroxidase family, members of which catalyze the reduction of organic hydroperoxides and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by glutathione, and thereby protect cells against oxidative damage. Other studies indicate that H2O2 is also essential for growth-factor mediated signal transduction, mitochondrial function, and maintenance of thiol redox-balance; therefore, by limiting H2O2 accumulation, glutathione peroxidases are also involved in modulating these processes. Several isozymes of this gene family exist in vertebrates, which vary in cellular location and substrate specificity. This isozyme is the most abundant, is ubiquitously expressed and localized in the cytoplasm, and whose preferred substrate is hydrogen peroxide. It is also a selenoprotein, containing the rare amino acid selenocysteine (Sec) at its active site. Sec is encoded by the UGA codon, which normally signals translation termination. The 3' UTRs of selenoprotein mRNAs contain a conserved stem-loop structure, designated the Sec insertion sequence (SECIS) element, that is necessary for the recognition of UGA as a Sec codon, rather than as a stop signal. This gene contains an in-frame GCG trinucleotide repeat in the coding region, and three alleles with 4, 5 or 6 repeats have been found in the human population. The allele with 4 GCG repeats has been significantly associated with breast cancer risk in premenopausal women. Alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. Pseudogenes of this locus have been identified on chromosomes X and 21. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2017]From UniProt:Protects the hemoglobin in erythrocytes from oxidative breakdown.

            "FLNB\t   The FLNB gene provides instructions for making a protein called filamin B. This protein helps build the network of protein filaments (cytoskeleton) that gives structure to cells and allows them to change shape and move. Filamin B attaches (binds) to another protein called actin and helps the actin to form the branching network of filaments that makes up the cytoskeleton. It also links actin to many other proteins to perform various functions within the cell, including the cell signaling that helps determine how the cytoskeleton will change as tissues grow and take shape during development.Filamin B is involved in the development of the skeleton before birth. It is active (expressed) in many cells and tissues of the body, including cartilage-forming cells called chondrocytes. Cartilage is a tough, flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone (a process called ossification), except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose, airways (trachea and bronchi), and external ears. Filamin B appears to be important for normal cell growth and division (proliferation) and maturation (differentiation) of chondrocytes and for the ossification of cartilage.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Atelosteogenesis type 1     At least seven FLNB gene mutations have been identified that cause atelosteogenesis type 1, a disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body. The mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the filamin B protein or delete a small section of the protein sequence, resulting in an abnormal protein. This abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with normal proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of atelosteogenesis type 1. More About This Health Condition      Atelosteogenesis type 3     At least six FLNB gene mutations have been identified that cause atelosteogenesis type 3, a disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body.

This abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with normal proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of boomerang dysplasia. More About This Health Condition      Larsen syndrome     At least 13 FLNB gene mutations have been identified that cause Larsen syndrome, a disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body.

This abnormal protein appears to have a new, atypical function that interferes with normal proliferation or differentiation of chondrocytes, impairing ossification and leading to the signs and symptoms of Larsen syndrome.It is not clear why similar mutations in the FLNB gene can result in four different disorders: atelosteogenesis type 1, atelosteogenesis type 3, boomerang dysplasia, or Larsen syndrome. Certain mutations in regions of the FLNB gene known as exons 2 through 5 seem to have the most harmful effects, usually resulting in the more severe disorders, atelosteogenesis type 1 and boomerang dysplasia. Atelosteogenesis type 3 and Larsen syndrome, which are less severe, are usually caused by apparently milder mutations in exons 2 through 5 or by mutations in exons 27 through 33. In a few cases, the same mutation has been associated with more than one of these disorders in different people. More About This Health Condition      Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome     At least five FLNB gene mutations have been identified that cause spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome, a disorder that affects the development of bones throughout the body. These mutations, which may occur in any region of the gene, result in the production of an abnormally short filamin B protein that is unstable and breaks down rapidly. Loss of the filamin B protein appears to result in out-of-place (ectopic) ossification, resulting in fusion of the bones in the spine, wrists, and ankles and other signs and symptoms of spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Several common variations (polymorphisms) in the FLNB gene have been associated with low bone mineral density (osteoporosis), which weakens the bones and makes them prone to fracture.

            "ATXN7\t   From NCBI Gene:The autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxias (ADCA) are a heterogeneous group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by progressive degeneration of the cerebellum, brain stem and spinal cord. Clinically, ADCA has been divided into three groups: ADCA types I-III. ADCAI is genetically heterogeneous, with five genetic loci, designated spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6, being assigned to five different chromosomes. ADCAII, which always presents with retinal degeneration (SCA7), and ADCAIII often referred to as the 'pure' cerebellar syndrome (SCA5), are most likely homogeneous disorders. Several SCA genes have been cloned and shown to contain CAG repeats in their coding regions. ADCA is caused by the expansion of the CAG repeats, producing an elongated polyglutamine tract in the corresponding protein. The expanded repeats are variable in size and unstable, usually increasing in size when transmitted to successive generations. This locus has been mapped to chromosome 3, and it has been determined that the diseased allele associated with spinocerebellar ataxia-7 contains 37-306 CAG repeats (near the N-terminus), compared to 4-35 in the normal allele. The encoded protein is a component of the SPT3/TAF9/GCN5 acetyltransferase (STAGA) and TBP-free TAF-containing (TFTC) chromatin remodeling complexes, and it thus plays a role in transcriptional regulation. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2016]From UniProt:Acts as component of the STAGA transcription coactivator-HAT complex.

            "CPOX\t   The CPOX gene provides instructions for making an enzyme known as coproporphyrinogen oxidase. This enzyme is involved in the production of a molecule called heme. Heme is vital for all of the body's organs, although it is most abundant in the blood, bone marrow, and liver. Heme is an essential component of iron-containing proteins called hemoproteins, including hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen in the blood).The production of heme is a multi-step process that requires eight different enzymes. Coproporphyrinogen oxidase is responsible for the sixth step in this process, the removal of carbon and oxygen atoms from coproporphyrinogen III (the product of the fifth step) to form protoporphyrinogen IX. In subsequent steps, two other enzymes modify protoporphyrinogen IX and incorporate an iron atom to produce heme.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Porphyria     At least 45 mutations in the CPOX gene have been found to cause porphyria.  Mutations in this gene can cause two types of porphyria: hereditary coproporphyria and a variant known as harderoporphyria.Most CPOX gene mutations change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in coproporphyrinogen oxidase. A single mutation appears to be responsible for harderoporphyria; this genetic change replaces the amino acid glycine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 404 (written as Lys404Glu or K404E).  Mutations in the CPOX gene reduce the activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase, allowing compounds called porphyrins to build up in the body. These compounds are formed during the normal process of heme production, but reduced activity of coproporphyrinogen oxidase allows them to accumulate to toxic levels. This buildup, in combination with nongenetic factors such as certain drugs, alcohol, and dieting, leads to the signs and symptoms of hereditary coproporphyria and harderoporphyria.

            "IL17RC\t   The IL17RC gene provides instructions for making a protein that is involved in immune system function, specifically in the body's defense against a fungus called Candida. When the immune system recognizes Candida, it generates cells called Th17 cells. These cells produce signaling molecules (cytokines) called the interleukin-17 (IL-17) family as part of an immune process called the IL-17 pathway. The IL-17 pathway creates inflammation, sending other cytokines and white blood cells that fight foreign invaders and promote tissue repair. In addition, the IL-17 pathway promotes the production of certain antimicrobial protein segments (peptides) that control growth of Candida on the surface of mucous membranes.The protein produced from the IL17RC gene is present in many tissue types in the body, and is involved in cell signaling as part of the IL-17 pathway. Together with the protein produced from the IL17RA gene, it forms one of several receptors for IL-17 cytokines. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. Certain IL-17 cytokines attach to receptors containing the IL17RC and IL17RA proteins, triggering signals that promote inflammation and the defense against Candida infection.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Familial candidiasis     At least three mutations in the IL17RC gene have been identified in people with familial candidiasis, an inherited tendency to develop infections caused by the Candida fungus (commonly known as yeast infections). Most people with familial candidiasis have chronic yeast infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes (collectively called chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis) beginning in early childhood.IL17RC gene mutations result in an absence of IL17RC receptor protein. Loss of this protein impairs binding of IL-17 cytokines and IL-17 signaling. This impaired signaling decreases production of the antimicrobial peptides and inflammatory molecules that are critical for defense against Candida, and results in the chronic infection that occurs in familial candidiasis.

FGFR family members differ from one another in their ligand affinities and tissue distribution. A full-length representative protein would consist of an extracellular region, composed of three immunoglobulin-like domains, a single hydrophobic membrane-spanning segment and a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The extracellular portion of the protein interacts with fibroblast growth factors, setting in motion a cascade of downstream signals, ultimately influencing mitogenesis and differentiation. A marked difference between this gene product and the other family members is its lack of a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase domain. The result is a transmembrane receptor that could interact with other family members and potentially inhibit signaling. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding the same isoform have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Has a negative effect on cell proliferation.

People with this CISD2 gene mutation also experience gastrointestinal ulcers and excessive bleeding after injury.The CISD2 gene mutation that causes Wolfram syndrome replaces the amino acid glutamic acid with the amino acid glutamine at position 37 in the CISD2 protein (written as Glu37Gln or E37Q). This mutation results in an abnormally small, nonfunctional CISD2 protein. As a result, the function of the mitochondria is impaired and they eventually break down. Since the mitochondria provide energy to cells, the loss of mitochondria leads to decreased energy for cells. Cells that do not have enough energy to function will eventually die. Cells with high energy demands, such as nerve cells in the brain, eyes, or gastrointestinal tract, are most susceptible to cell death due to reduced energy.

            "FAT4\t   The FAT4 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is found in most tissues. The protein spans the membrane surrounding cells so that part of the protein is outside the cell and part of the protein is inside the cell. The precise function of the FAT4 protein is largely unknown; however, research shows that the FAT4 protein is likely involved in determining the position of various components within cells (cell polarity). The FAT4 protein is also thought to function as a tumor suppressor, which means that it keeps cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Hennekam syndrome     At least seven mutations in the FAT4 gene have been found to cause Hennekam syndrome, an inherited disorder resulting from malformation of the lymphatic system, which consists of a network of vessels that transport lymph fluid and immune cells throughout the body. The FAT4 gene mutations that cause Hennekam syndrome reduce the activity of the FAT4 protein, which seems to impair normal development of the lymphatic system. However, the mechanism is unknown. A poorly formed lymphatic system leads to lymphatic vessels that are abnormally expanded (lymphangiectasia) and are prone to break open (rupture), puffiness or swelling caused by a buildup of fluid (lymphedema), and other features of Hennekam syndrome. FAT4 gene mutations account for about 25 percent of all cases of Hennekam syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Mutations in the FAT4 gene have also been found in individuals who have van Maldergem syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability, hearing loss, skeletal abnormalities, and a brain malformation called periventricular heterotopia. The FAT4 gene mutations that cause van Maldergem syndrome lead to a decrease in FAT4 protein function. It is thought that a decrease in FAT4 protein activity in the brain disrupts the polarity of nerve cells in the brain, which leads to periventricular heterotopia.It is unknown how mutations in the FAT4 gene can cause the signs and symptoms of van Maldergem syndrome in some people but lead to different signs and symptoms in those with Hennekam syndrome (described above). One mutation that replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glutamic acid with the amino acid lysine at position 2375 in the FAT4 protein (written as Glu2375Lys or E2375K) has been found in both individuals with van Maldergem syndrome and those with Hennekam syndrome.FAT4 gene mutations have also been found in many types of cancers, including a type of skin cancer called head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, an aggressive form of skin cancer called melanoma, a liver cancer called hepatocellular carcinoma, stomach (gastric) cancer, and pancreatic cancer. The FAT4 gene mutations involved in these cancers are different from the ones that cause van Maldergem syndrome and Hennekam syndrome (described above). The FAT4 gene mutations associated with cancers are called somatic mutations; they are found only in cells that become cancerous and are not inherited. It is likely that these mutations prevent the FAT4 protein from acting as a tumor suppressor, contributing to the uncontrollable growth and division of cells that is characteristic of cancer. People with van Maldergem syndrome and Hennekam syndrome are not thought to have an increased risk of developing cancer.

            "TLR3\t   From NCBI Gene:The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the Toll-like receptor (TLR) family which plays a fundamental role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This receptor is most abundantly expressed in placenta and pancreas, and is restricted to the dendritic subpopulation of the leukocytes. It recognizes dsRNA associated with viral infection, and induces the activation of NF-kappaB and the production of type I interferons. It may thus play a role in host defense against viruses. Use of alternative polyadenylation sites to generate different length transcripts has been noted for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Key component of innate and adaptive immunity. TLRs (Toll-like receptors) control host immune response against pathogens through recognition of molecular patterns specific to microorganisms. TLR3 is a nucleotide-sensing TLR which is activated by double-stranded RNA, a sign of viral infection. Acts via the adapter TRIF/TICAM1, leading to NF-kappa-B activation, IRF3 nuclear translocation, cytokine secretion and the inflammatory response.

            "HTT\t   The HTT gene provides instructions for making a protein called huntingtin.  Although the exact function of this protein is unknown, it appears to play an important role in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and is essential for normal development before birth.  Huntingtin is found in many of the body's tissues, with the highest levels of activity in the brain.  Within cells, this protein may be involved in chemical signaling, transporting materials, attaching (binding) to proteins and other structures, and protecting the cell from self-destruction (apoptosis).One region of the HTT gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat.   This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row.  Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 10 to 35 times within the gene.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Huntington disease     The inherited mutation that causes Huntington disease is known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat expansion.  This mutation increases the size of the CAG segment in the HTT gene.  People with Huntington disease have 36 to more than 120 CAG repeats. People with 36 to 39 CAG repeats may or may not develop the signs and symptoms of Huntington disease, while people with 40 or more repeats almost always develop the disorder.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the huntingtin protein. The elongated protein is cut into smaller, toxic fragments that bind together and accumulate in neurons, disrupting the normal functions of these cells. This process particularly affects regions of the brain that help coordinate movement and control thinking and emotions (the striatum and cerebral cortex).  The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in these areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of Huntington disease.As the altered HTT gene is passed from one generation to the next, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat often increases in size. A larger number of repeats is usually associated with an earlier onset of signs and symptoms. This phenomenon is called anticipation. People with the adult-onset form of Huntington disease (which appears in mid-adulthood) typically have 40 to 50 CAG repeats in the HTT gene, while people with the less common, juvenile form of the disorder (which appears in childhood or adolescence) tend to have more than 60 CAG repeats.Individuals who have 27 to 35 CAG repeats in the HTT gene do not develop Huntington disease, but they are at risk of having children who will develop the disorder. As the gene is passed from parent to child, the size of the CAG trinucleotide repeat may lengthen into the range associated with Huntington disease (36 repeats or more).

            "EVC\t   The EVC gene provides instructions for making a protein whose function is unclear. However, it appears to be important for normal growth and development, particularly the development of bones and teeth. The EVC protein is found in primary cilia, which are microscopic, finger-like projections that stick out from the surface of cells and are involved in signaling pathways that transmit information between cells. In particular, the EVC protein is thought to help regulate a signaling pathway known as Sonic Hedgehog, which plays roles in cell growth, cell specialization, and the normal shaping (patterning) of many parts of the body.EVC and another gene, EVC2, are located very close together on chromosome 4. Researchers believe that the two genes may have related functions and that their activity may be coordinated.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Ellis-van Creveld syndrome     More than 25 mutations in the EVC gene have been reported to cause Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, an inherited disorder characterized by dwarfism, abnormal nails and teeth, and heart defects. The mutations that cause this condition occur in both copies of the EVC gene in each cell. These genetic changes disrupt the normal function of the EVC protein or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the protein. Although it is unclear how the loss of this protein's function underlies the signs and symptoms of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, researchers believe that it may prevent normal Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo. Problems with this signaling pathway may ultimately lead to the abnormal bone growth and heart defects seen with this condition. More About This Health Condition      Weyers acrofacial dysostosis     At least one mutation in the EVC gene has been found to cause the characteristic features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis, affecting the development of the teeth, nails, and bones. The signs and symptoms of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis are similar to, but typically milder than, those of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome.The EVC gene mutation that causes Weyers acrofacial dysostosis occurs in one copy of the gene in each cell. It changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the EVC protein, replacing the amino acid serine with the amino acid proline at position 307 (written as Ser307Pro). It is unclear how this genetic change leads to the specific features of Weyers acrofacial dysostosis. Studies suggest that the abnormal protein interferes with Sonic Hedgehog signaling in the developing embryo, disrupting the normal formation and growth of the teeth, nails, and bones.

Alpha-fetoprotein expression in adults is often associated with hepatoma or teratoma. However, hereditary persistance of alpha-fetoprotein may also be found in individuals with no obvious pathology. The protein is thought to be the fetal counterpart of serum albumin, and the alpha-fetoprotein and albumin genes are present in tandem in the same transcriptional orientation on chromosome 4. Alpha-fetoprotein is found in monomeric as well as dimeric and trimeric forms, and binds copper, nickel, fatty acids and bilirubin.

            "FRAS1\t   The FRAS1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that is part of a group of proteins called the FRAS/FREM complex. This complex is found in basement membranes, which are thin, sheet-like structures that separate and support cells in many tissues. The FRAS/FREM complex is particularly important during development before birth. One of its roles is to anchor the top layer of skin by connecting the basement membrane of the top layer to the layer of skin below. The FRAS/FREM complex is also involved in the proper development of certain other organs and tissues, including the kidneys, although the mechanism is unclear.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Fraser syndrome     At least 24 mutations in the FRAS1 gene cause a condition called Fraser syndrome; FRAS1 gene mutations account for about half of cases of this condition. Fraser syndrome affects development before birth and is characterized by eyes that are completely covered by skin (cryptophthalmos), fusion of the skin between the fingers and toes (cutaneous syndactyly), and abnormalities of the kidneys and other organs and tissues.Most mutations in the FRAS1 gene involved in Fraser syndrome lead to production of an abnormal protein with little or no function. The abnormal protein is likely broken down quickly, preventing formation of the FRAS/FREM complex. Lack of the FRAS/FREM complex in the basement membrane of the skin leads to detachment of the top layer, causing blisters to form during development. These blisters likely prevent the proper formation of certain structures before birth, leading to cryptophthalmos and cutaneous syndactyly.

            "DSPP\t   The DSPP gene provides instructions for making a protein called dentin sialophosphoprotein. Soon after it is produced, this protein is cut into two smaller proteins: dentin sialoprotein and dentin phosphoprotein. These proteins are components of dentin, which is a bone-like substance that makes up the protective middle layer of each tooth. A third smaller protein produced from dentin sialophosphoprotein, called dentin glycoprotein, was identified in pigs but has not been found in humans.Although the exact functions of the DSPP-derived proteins are unknown, these proteins appear to be essential for normal tooth development. Dentin phosphoprotein is thought to be involved in the normal hardening of collagen, the most abundant protein in dentin. Specifically, dentin phosphoprotein may play a role in the deposition of mineral crystals among collagen fibers (mineralization).The DSPP gene is also active in the inner ear, although it is unclear whether it plays a role in normal hearing.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Dentinogenesis imperfecta     More than 20 mutations in the DSPP gene have been identified in people with dentinogenesis imperfecta. These genetic changes are responsible for two forms of this disorder, type II and type III. Mutations in this gene also cause dentin dysplasia type II, a disorder with signs and symptoms very similar to those of dentinogenesis imperfecta. However, dentin dysplasia type II affects the primary (baby) teeth much more than the permanent teeth. Some researchers believe that this type of dentin dysplasia and dentinogenesis imperfecta types II and III are actually forms of a single disorder.About half of DSPP gene mutations affect dentin sialoprotein, altering its transport in cells. The remaining mutations affect dentin phosphoprotein, interfering with its normal production and/or secretion. As a result of these abnormalities of DSPP-related proteins, teeth have abnormally soft dentin. Teeth with defective dentin are discolored, weak, and prone to breakage and decay.Although the DSPP gene is active in the inner ear, it is unclear whether DSPP gene mutations are related to the hearing loss found in a few older individuals with dentinogenesis imperfecta type II.

Some researchers believe that this type of dentin dysplasia and dentinogenesis imperfecta types II and III are actually forms of a single disorder.About half of DSPP gene mutations affect dentin sialoprotein, altering its transport in cells. The remaining mutations affect dentin phosphoprotein, interfering with its normal production and/or secretion. As a result of these abnormalities of DSPP-related proteins, teeth have abnormally soft dentin. Teeth with defective dentin are discolored, weak, and prone to breakage and decay.Although the DSPP gene is active in the inner ear, it is unclear whether DSPP gene mutations are related to the hearing loss found in a few older individuals with dentinogenesis imperfecta type II.

            "DMP1\t   From NCBI Gene:Dentin matrix acidic phosphoprotein is an extracellular matrix protein and a member of the small integrin binding ligand N-linked glycoprotein family. This protein, which is critical for proper mineralization of bone and dentin, is present in diverse cells of bone and tooth tissues. The protein contains a large number of acidic domains, multiple phosphorylation sites, a functional arg-gly-asp cell attachment sequence, and a DNA binding domain. In undifferentiated osteoblasts it is primarily a nuclear protein that regulates the expression of osteoblast-specific genes. During osteoblast maturation the protein becomes phosphorylated and is exported to the extracellular matrix, where it orchestrates mineralized matrix formation. Mutations in the gene are known to cause autosomal recessive hypophosphatemia, a disease that manifests as rickets and osteomalacia. The gene structure is conserved in mammals. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been described for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:May have a dual function during osteoblast differentiation. In the nucleus of undifferentiated osteoblasts, unphosphorylated form acts as a transcriptional component for activation of osteoblast-specific genes like osteocalcin. During the osteoblast to osteocyte transition phase it is phosphorylated and exported into the extracellular matrix, where it regulates nucleation of hydroxyapatite.

Actin polymerization involves proteins known to interact with diaphanous protein in Drosophila and mouse. It has therefore been speculated that this gene may have a role in the regulation of actin polymerization in hair cells of the inner ear. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Actin nucleation and elongation factor required for the assembly of F-actin structures, such as actin cables and stress fibers (By similarity). Binds to the barbed end of the actin filament and slows down actin polymerization and depolymerization (By similarity). Required for cytokinesis, and transcriptional activation of the serum response factor (By similarity). DFR proteins couple Rho and Src tyrosine kinase during signaling and the regulation of actin dynamics (By similarity). Functions as a scaffold protein for MAPRE1 and APC to stabilize microtubules and promote cell migration (By similarity). Has neurite outgrowth promoting activity. Acts in a Rho-dependent manner to recruit PFY1 to the membrane (By similarity). In hear cells, it may play a role in the regulation of actin polymerization in hair cells (PubMed:20937854, PubMed:21834987, PubMed:26912466). The MEMO1-RHOA-DIAPH1 signaling pathway plays an important role in ERBB2-dependent stabilization of microtubules at the cell cortex (PubMed:20937854, PubMed:21834987). It controls the localization of APC and CLASP2 to the cell membrane, via the regulation of GSK3B activity (PubMed:20937854, PubMed:21834987). In turn, membrane-bound APC allows the localization of the MACF1 to the cell membrane, which is required for microtubule capture and stabilization (PubMed:20937854, PubMed:21834987). Plays a role in the regulation of cell morphology and cytoskeletal organization. Required in the control of cell shape (PubMed:20937854, PubMed:21834987).

            "PPP2R2B\t   From NCBI Gene:The product of this gene belongs to the phosphatase 2 regulatory subunit B family. Protein phosphatase 2 is one of the four major Ser/Thr phosphatases, and it is implicated in the negative control of cell growth and division. It consists of a common heteromeric core enzyme, which is composed of a catalytic subunit and a constant regulatory subunit, that associates with a variety of regulatory subunits. The B regulatory subunit might modulate substrate selectivity and catalytic activity. This gene encodes a beta isoform of the regulatory subunit B55 subfamily. Defects in this gene cause autosomal dominant spinocerebellar ataxia 12 (SCA12), a disease caused by degeneration of the cerebellum, sometimes involving the brainstem and spinal cord, and in resulting in poor coordination of speech and body movements. Multiple alternatively spliced variants, which encode different isoforms, have been identified for this gene. The 5' UTR of some of these variants includes a CAG trinucleotide repeat sequence (7-28 copies) that can be expanded to 55-78 copies in cases of SCA12.

            "TCOF1\t   The TCOF1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called treacle.  This protein is active during early embryonic development in structures that become bones and other tissues of the face, and it appears to play a critical role in the formation of these structures.Studies suggest that treacle is involved in the production of a molecule called ribosomal RNA (rRNA), a chemical cousin of DNA. Ribosomal RNA helps assemble protein building blocks (amino acids) into functioning proteins, which is essential for the normal functioning and survival of cells. Treacle is active in the nucleolus, which is a small region inside the nucleus where rRNA is produced.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Treacher Collins syndrome     About 200 mutations in the TCOF1 gene have been identified in people with Treacher Collins syndrome, a condition that affects the development of bones and other tissues of the face. Most of these mutations insert or delete a small number of DNA building blocks (base pairs) in the TCOF1 gene, which leads to a reduction in the amount of functional treacle in cells. As a result, the production of rRNA is reduced, which likely triggers the self-destruction (apoptosis) of certain cells involved in the early development of facial bones and tissues. Researchers believe that this abnormal cell death may lead to the specific problems with facial development found in Treacher Collins syndrome.

            "IRGM\t   The IRGM gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. This protein is involved in a process called autophagy, which cells use to surround and destroy foreign invaders such as bacteria and viruses. Specifically, the IRGM protein helps trigger autophagy in cells infected with certain kinds of bacteria, including the type of bacteria that causes tuberculosis. In addition to protecting cells from infection, autophagy is used to recycle worn-out cell parts and break down certain proteins when they are no longer needed. This process also plays an important role in controlled cell death (apoptosis).

This increased risk has been found primarily in people of northern European ancestry. IRGM variations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in regions of DNA that may regulate when and how the IRGM protein is produced. Researchers suspect that changes involving the IRGM protein may disrupt the autophagy process, preventing the immune system from destroying harmful bacteria effectively.

It is expressed in breast tissue and together with other proteins, it forms a complex with BRCA1 and BRCA2, thus is potentially associated with higher risk of breast cancer. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been noted for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2008]From UniProt:Receptor for hyaluronic acid (HA) (By similarity). Involved in cell motility (By similarity). When hyaluronan binds to HMMR, the phosphorylation of a number of proteins, including PTK2/FAK1 occurs. May also be involved in cellular transformation and metastasis formation, and in regulating extracellular-regulated kinase (ERK) activity. May act as a regulator of adipogenisis (By similarity).

            "FGFR4\t   The FGFR4 gene provides instructions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 4. This protein is part of a family of fibroblast growth factor receptors that share similar structures and functions. These receptor proteins play a role in important processes such as cell division, regulating cell growth and maturation, formation of blood vessels, wound healing, and embryo development.The FGFR4 protein interacts with specific growth factors to conduct signals from the environment outside the cell to the nucleus. The nucleus responds to these signals by switching on or off appropriate genes that help the cell adjust to changes in the environment. In response, the cell might divide, move, or mature to take on specialized functions. Although specific functions of FGFR4 remain unclear, studies indicate that the gene is involved in muscle development and the maturation of bone cells in the skull. The FGFR4 gene may also play a role in the development and maintenance of specialized cells (called foveal cones) in the light-sensitive layer (the retina) at the back of the eye.

            "NSD1\t   The NSD1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that functions as a histone methyltransferase. Histone methyltransferases are enzymes that modify structural proteins called histones, which attach (bind) to DNA and give chromosomes their shape. By adding a molecule called a methyl group to histones (a process called methylation), histone methyltransferases control (regulate) the activity of certain genes and can turn them on and off as needed. The NSD1 enzyme controls the activity of genes involved in normal growth and development, although most of these genes have not been identified.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Sotos syndrome     More than 380 mutations in the NSD1 gene have been identified in people with Sotos syndrome. The most common mutation in the Japanese population deletes genetic material from the region of chromosome 5 that contains the NSD1 gene. In most other populations, mutations within the gene itself are more frequent. These mutations include insertions or deletions of a small amount of DNA and changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs) that make up the gene. Most mutations prevent one copy of the NSD1 gene from making any enzyme or lead to the production of an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. Research suggests that a reduced amount of the NSD1 enzyme disrupts the normal activity of genes involved in growth and development. However, it remains unclear exactly how a shortage of this enzyme during development leads to overgrowth, learning disabilities, and the other signs and symptoms of Sotos syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     A change involving the NSD1 gene is associated with a blood cancer called childhood acute myeloid leukemia. This change occurs when part of chromosome 5 breaks off and reattaches to part of chromosome 11. This change is acquired during a person's lifetime and is present only in cancer cells. This type of genetic change, called a somatic mutation, is not inherited. The rearrangement of genetic material involved in childhood acute myeloid leukemia, known as a translocation, abnormally fuses the NSD1 gene on chromosome 5 with the NUP98 gene on chromosome 11. Research shows that the fused NUP98-NSD1 gene turns on genes that promote the growth of immature blood cells and blocks processes that would turn the genes off. The resulting overgrowth of these immature cells leads to development of acute myeloid leukemia.A different type of alteration involving the NSD1 gene is associated with a cancer of nerve tissue called neuroblastoma and a type of brain cancer called glioma. This alteration, known as promoter hypermethylation, turns off the production of the NSD1 enzyme. Researchers speculate that without NSD1, the activity of one or more genes involved in cell growth and division is uncontrolled. As a result, the cells can grow and divide unchecked, leading to the development of cancer.

These cells produce a pigment called melanin, which is the substance that gives skin, hair, and eyes their color. Melanin is also found in the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye (the retina), where it plays a role in normal vision.Although the exact function of the SLC45A2 protein is unknown, it is likely involved in the production of melanin.  This protein probably transports molecules necessary for the normal function of melanosomes, which are the structures in melanocytes where melanin is produced. Studies suggest that certain common variations (polymorphisms) in the SLC45A2 gene may be associated with normal differences in skin, hair, and eye coloring.

The most common SLC45A2 mutation in the Japanese population switches a single protein building block (amino acid) in the SLC45A2 protein.  Specifically, this mutation replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid asparagine at protein position 157 (written as Asp157Asn or D157N).  Other mutations, including changes in single amino acids and deletions or insertions of genetic material in the SLC45A2 gene, have also been reported in several populations worldwide.  Mutations in this gene reduce or eliminate the function of the SLC45A2 protein in melanin production.

            "AMACR\t   The AMACR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR). This enzyme is found in the energy-producing centers in cells (mitochondria) and in cell structures called peroxisomes. Peroxisomes contain a variety of enzymes that break down many different substances, including fatty acids and certain toxic compounds. They are also important for the production (synthesis) of fats (lipids) used in digestion and in the nervous system.In peroxisomes, the AMACR enzyme plays a role in the breakdown of a fatty acid called pristanic acid, which comes from meat and dairy foods in the diet. In mitochondria, AMACR is thought to help further break down the molecules derived from pristanic acid.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase deficiency     Alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) deficiency is caused by mutations in the AMACR gene. This disorder leads to a variety of neurological problems that begin in adulthood, including gradual loss in intellectual functioning (cognitive decline), seizures, and weakness and loss of sensation in the limbs due to nerve damage (sensorimotor neuropathy). Most individuals with AMACR deficiency have an AMACR gene mutation that replaces a protein building block (amino acid) called serine with an amino acid called proline at position 52 in the enzyme sequence, written as Ser52Pro or S52P. This mutation results in a lack (deficiency) of functional enzyme. The enzyme deficiency leads to accumulation of pristanic acid in the blood. However, it is unclear how this accumulation is related to the specific signs and symptoms of AMACR deficiency. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     AMACR gene mutations that result in a lack of functional AMACR enzyme have also been identified in infants with a life-threatening disorder called congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4. Babies with this disorder have cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile. Cholestasis leads to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis) in the first few months of life.Some researchers consider congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4 and AMACR deficiency (see above) to be variations of the same disorder. Because most individuals with congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4 do not survive infancy, it is unclear whether they would have later developed the neurological symptoms seen in adults with AMACR deficiency.

Babies with this disorder have cholestasis, which is a reduced ability to produce and release a digestive fluid called bile. Cholestasis leads to an enlarged liver (hepatomegaly) and irreversible liver disease (cirrhosis) in the first few months of life.Some researchers consider congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4 and AMACR deficiency (see above) to be variations of the same disorder. Because most individuals with congenital bile acid synthesis defect type 4 do not survive infancy, it is unclear whether they would have later developed the neurological symptoms seen in adults with AMACR deficiency.

            "GHR\t   The GHR gene provides instructions for making a protein called the growth hormone receptor. This receptor is embedded in the outer membrane of cells throughout the body and is most abundant in liver cells.The growth hormone receptor has three major parts: An extracellular region that sticks out from the surface of the cell, a transmembrane region that anchors the receptor to the cell membrane, and an intracellular region that transmits signals to the interior of the cell. The extracellular region attaches (binds) to a substance called growth hormone, fitting together like a lock and its key. The binding of growth hormone triggers signaling via the intracellular region of the receptor that stimulates the growth and division of cells. This signaling also leads to the production, primarily by liver cells, of another important growth-promoting hormone called insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I).Growth hormone and IGF-I have a wide variety of effects on the growth and function of many parts of the body. For example, these hormones stimulate the growth and division of cells called chondrocytes, which play a critical role in producing new bone tissue. Growth hormone and IGF-I also influence metabolism, including how the body uses and stores carbohydrates, proteins, and fats from food.Researchers have identified two major versions (isoforms) of the growth hormone receptor. The two isoforms differ by the presence or absence of a particular segment known as exon 3, which is located in the extracellular region of the receptor. The version of the receptor that includes exon 3 is known as the full-length isoform (fl-GHR), while the version that is missing exon 3 is known as the exon 3-deficient isoform (d3-GHR). Both isoforms are relatively common in most populations. Each individual can have fl-GHR only, d3-GHR only, or a  mix of both isoforms. The two isoforms bind to growth hormone in the same way on the surface of cells, but for reasons that are unclear, d3-GHR is associated with enhanced signaling within cells compared with fl-GHR.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Laron syndrome     At least 70 mutations in the GHR gene have been found to cause Laron syndrome, a rare form of short stature that is also characterized by obesity, a distinctive facial appearance, and other signs and symptoms affecting multiple body systems. All of the identified mutations impair the function of the growth hormone receptor. Most of the mutations affect the extracellular region of the receptor, preventing it from binding to growth hormone effectively. A few mutations affect the intracellular region of the receptor, reducing or eliminating its ability to trigger the signals that promote growth.Although people with GHR gene mutations produce growth hormone, the defective receptors prevent cells from responding to the hormone by producing IGF-I or triggering cell growth and division. The cells' inability to react to growth hormone, which is described as growth hormone insensitivity, disrupts the normal growth of many different tissues. Short stature results when growth hormone cannot adequately stimulate the growth of bones. Changes in metabolism caused by insensitivity to growth hormone and the resulting shortage of IGF-I cause many of the other features of the condition, including obesity.Studies suggest that people with Laron syndrome have a significantly reduced risk of cancer and type 2 diabetes. Affected individuals appear to develop these common diseases much less frequently than their unaffected relatives, despite having obesity (a risk factor for both cancer and type 2 diabetes). Researchers are working to determine how mutations in the GHR gene may protect people with Laron syndrome from developing these diseases. Studies suggest that insensitivity to growth hormone may help prevent the uncontrolled growth and division of cells that can lead to the development of cancerous tumors. Growth hormone insensitivity also appears to alter how the body responds to insulin, which is a hormone that regulates blood sugar levels. Resistance to the effects of insulin is a major risk factor for type 2 diabetes. People with Laron syndrome have the opposite situation, an increased sensitivity to insulin, which likely helps explain their reduced risk of this disease. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     The two isoforms of the growth hormone receptor have been studied in several conditions involving problems with growth. These conditions include short stature resulting from a shortage (deficiency) of growth hormone, slow growth starting before birth (small for gestational age), and short stature of unknown cause (idiopathic short stature). Some studies have found that children with these disorders respond differently to treatment depending on which isoform of the growth hormone receptor they have. Specifically, d3-GHR has been associated with faster growth during treatment compared with fl-GHR. Other studies have not found a difference in growth, although all of the studies used different methodologies and included relatively few participants.The two isoforms of the growth hormone receptor have also been studied in adults with acromegaly, a disorder characterized by increased levels of growth hormone. The abnormally high levels are most often caused by a noncancerous tumor in the pituitary gland, which is the part of the brain where growth hormone is produced. In response to the excess growth hormone, the bones of the hands, feet, and face grow unusually large. Other signs and symptoms of this condition can include thickened skin, increased sweating and body odor, enlargement of certain organs, muscle weakness, and excessive tiredness (fatigue). In adults with acromegaly, studies suggest that having the d3-GHR isoform is associated with better response to treatment compared with having fl-GHR. However, having d3-GHR appears to increase the risk of certain complications of the disease compared with having fl-GHR. The reasons for these differences are not fully understood.Whether a person has fl-GHR or d3-GHR does not seem to affect adult height in people without a growth disorder. Many genetic and non-genetic factors, some of which are unknown, influence how tall a person will be.

Two of the 46 chromosomes, known as X and Y, are called sex chromosomes because they help determine whether a person will develop male or female sex characteristics. Girls and women typically have two X chromosomes (46,XX karyotype), while boys and men usually have one X chromosome and one Y chromosome (46,XY karyotype).The MAP3K1 gene mutations that cause Swyer syndrome increase cofactor binding, which decreases signaling that leads to male sexual differentiation and enhances signaling that leads to female sexual differentiation.

            "ARSB\t   The ARSB gene provides instructions for producing an enzyme called arylsulfatase B, which is involved in the breakdown of large sugar molecules called glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Specifically, arylsulfatase B removes a chemical group known as a sulfate from two GAGs called dermatan sulfate and chondroitin sulfate. Arylsulfatase B is located in lysosomes, compartments within cells that digest and recycle different types of molecules.

Most of these mutations change single DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene. All of the mutations that cause MPS VI reduce or eliminate the function of arylsulfatase B. It usually cannot be determined whether a certain mutation will cause severe or mild MPS VI; however, mutations known to result in the complete absence of arylsulfatase B activity cause severe signs and symptoms.The lack of arylsulfatase B activity leads to the accumulation of GAGs within lysosomes. Conditions such as MPS VI that cause molecules to build up inside the lysosomes are called lysosomal storage disorders.

            "MTRR\t   The MTRR gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called methionine synthase reductase. This enzyme is required for the proper function of another enzyme called methionine synthase. Methionine synthase helps process amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Specifically, it converts the amino acid homocysteine to another amino acid called methionine. After a period of being turned on (active), methionine synthase turns off (becomes inactive). Methionine synthase reductase reactivates methionine synthase so the enzyme can continue to produce methionine.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Homocystinuria     At least 20 mutations in the MTRR gene have been identified in people with homocystinuria. Some of these mutations change single amino acids in methionine synthase reductase. Other mutations lead to an abnormally small, nonfunctional version of the enzyme. All these mutations prevent the enzyme from functioning normally. Without methionine synthase reductase, methionine synthase cannot convert homocysteine to methionine. As a result, homocysteine builds up in the bloodstream, and the amount of methionine is reduced. Some of the excess homocysteine is excreted in urine. Researchers have not determined how altered levels of homocysteine and methionine lead to the health problems associated with homocystinuria. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     A specific version (variant) of the MTRR gene may be associated with an increased risk of various health problems before birth. The variant replaces a building block of DNA (nucleotide) called adenine with the nucleotide guanine at position 66 of the MTRR gene (written as A66G). This variant is associated with birth defects that occur during the development of the brain and spinal cord (neural tube defects). This variant may also increase the risk of having a child with Down syndrome, a condition characterized by intellectual disability and associated health problems. Researchers have not determined why there may be a connection between the A66G variant of the MTRR gene and the risk of neural tube defects or Down syndrome. Many factors play a part in determining the risk of these disorders.

MutS beta initiates mismatch repair by binding to a mismatch and then forming a complex with MutL alpha heterodimer. This gene contains a polymorphic 9 bp tandem repeat sequence in the first exon. The repeat is present 6 times in the reference genome sequence and 3-7 repeats have been reported. Defects in this gene are a cause of susceptibility to endometrial cancer. [provided by RefSeq, Mar 2011]From UniProt:Component of the post-replicative DNA mismatch repair system (MMR). Heterodimerizes with MSH2 to form MutS beta which binds to DNA mismatches thereby initiating DNA repair. When bound, the MutS beta heterodimer bends the DNA helix and shields approximately 20 base pairs. MutS beta recognizes large insertion-deletion loops (IDL) up to 13 nucleotides long. After mismatch binding, forms a ternary complex with the MutL alpha heterodimer, which is thought to be responsible for directing the downstream MMR events, including strand discrimination, excision, and resynthesis.

            "ERAP1\t   The ERAP1 gene (also known as ERAAP and ARTS1) provides instructions for making a protein called endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1. As its name suggests, this protein is active in a cellular structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, which is involved in protein processing and transport. This protein is an aminopeptidase, which is an enzyme that cuts (cleaves) other proteins into smaller fragments called peptides.Endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 has two major functions, both of which are important for normal immune system function. First, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 cleaves several proteins called cytokine receptors on the surface of cells.  Cleaving these receptors reduces their ability to transmit chemical signals into the cell, which affects the process of inflammation.Second, endoplasmic reticulum aminopeptidase 1 cleaves many types of proteins into small peptides that can be recognized by the immune system.  These peptides are exported to the cell surface, where they attach to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins.  MHC class I proteins display the peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it responds by triggering the infected cell to self-destruct.

            "LAMA4\t   From NCBI Gene:Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the alpha chain isoform laminin, alpha 4. The domain structure of alpha 4 is similar to that of alpha 3, both of which resemble truncated versions of alpha 1 and alpha 2, in that approximately 1,200 residues at the N-terminus (domains IV, V and VI) have been lost. Laminin, alpha 4 contains the C-terminal G domain which distinguishes all alpha chains from the beta and gamma chains. The RNA analysis from adult and fetal tissues revealed developmental regulation of expression, however, the exact function of laminin, alpha 4 is not known. Tissue-specific utilization of alternative polyA-signal has been described in literature. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants encoding distinct isoforms. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]From UniProt:Binding to cells via a high affinity receptor, laminin is thought to mediate the attachment, migration and organization of cells into tissues during embryonic development by interacting with other extracellular matrix components.

            "TSPYL1\t   The TSPYL1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called TSPY-like 1. This protein is active in the brain, testes (in males), and other tissues, although its function is not well understood. TSPY-like 1 contains a region called a nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) domain, which is found in other proteins that help control cell division, copy (replicate) DNA, and regulate the activity of various genes. It is unknown whether TSPY-like 1 also has these functions.Based on its role in a condition called sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome, researchers propose that TSPY-like 1 is involved in the development of the male reproductive system and the brain, including the brainstem. The brainstem is a part of the brain that is connected to the spinal cord. It regulates many basic body functions, including heart rate, breathing, eating, and sleeping. It also relays information about movement and the senses between the brain and the rest of the body.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome     A single mutation in the TSPYL1 gene has caused all identified cases of sudden infant death with dysgenesis of the testes syndrome (SIDDT), a condition that has been reported in an Old Order Amish community in Pennsylvania. The condition is fatal in the first year of life; its major features include abnormalities of the reproductive system in males, breathing problems, a slow or uneven heart rate, and feeding difficulties.The mutation that causes SIDDT inserts a single DNA building block (nucleotide) into the TSPYL1 gene. This mutation is written as 457_458insG. The extra nucleotide alters how the gene's instructions are used to make TSPY-like 1, which results in the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. A loss of TSPY-like 1 function appears to disrupt the normal development of the male reproductive system and the brain, including the brainstem. Abnormalities of brainstem function, particularly involving breathing and heart rate, are likely the cause of sudden death in affected infants.Research findings suggest that mutations in the TSPYL1 gene are not associated with sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) in the general population. SIDS is a major cause of death in children younger than 1 year. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Changes in the TSPYL1 gene have been studied as a potential cause of infertility, which is the inability to have biological children. Variations in the gene have been identified in several infertile men and in at least one person who was genetically male (with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell) but had external genitalia that appeared female. However, it is unclear whether the TSPYL1 gene variations were related to these abnormalities or occurred by coincidence.

            "OPRM1\t   The OPRM1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called the mu (μ) opioid receptor. Opioid receptors are part of the endogenous opioid system, which is the body's internal system for regulating pain, reward, and addictive behaviors. It consists of opioid substances produced naturally within the body (called endogenous opioids) and their receptors, into which opioids fit like keys into locks. Opioid receptors are found in the nervous system, where they are embedded in the outer membrane of nerve cells (neurons). When opioids attach (bind) to the receptors, the interaction triggers a series of chemical changes within and between neurons that lead to feelings of pleasure and pain relief.The μ opioid receptor was the first opioid receptor to be discovered. It is the primary receptor for endogenous opioids called beta-endorphin and enkephalins, which help regulate the body's response to pain, among other functions. The μ opioid receptor is also the binding site for many opioids introduced from outside the body (called exogenous opioids). These include commonly prescribed pain medications such as oxycodone, fentanyl, buprenorphine, methadone, oxymorphone, hydrocodone, codeine, and morphine, as well as illegal opioid drugs such as heroin.When endogenous or exogenous opioids bind to the μ opioid receptor, the interaction triggers a cascade of chemical signals in the nervous system. These signals reduce the activity (excitability) of neurons in certain areas of the brain, which leads to pain relief and feelings of pleasure and intense happiness (euphoria). In addition, the chemical signaling ultimately increases the production of a chemical called dopamine. Dopamine is a chemical messenger (neurotransmitter) that helps regulate areas of the brain involved in reward-seeking behavior, attention, and mood.

More About This Health Condition      Opioid addiction     Common variations (polymorphisms) in the OPRM1 gene have been studied as risk factors for opioid addiction. Opioid addiction is a long-lasting (chronic) disease characterized by a powerful, sometimes uncontrollable urge to use opioid drugs. Opioid addiction has major health, social, and economic effects.The best-studied OPRM1 gene polymorphism changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a particular place in the μ opioid receptor protein. Specifically, it replaces the amino acid alanine (A) with the amino acid glycine (G) at position 118, written as Ala118Gly or A118G. (This polymorphism is also identified with a unique number, rs1799971.) The A118G polymorphism likely has an effect on the amount of μ opioid receptor present in the membrane surrounding neurons, and on the ability of the receptor to transmit chemical signals. Research into the association of this polymorphism with opioid addiction has had mixed results. Some studies suggest that having glycine (G) instead of alanine (A) increases the amount of an opioid medication needed to achieve pain relief and raises the risk of opioid addiction. However, other studies found no association between the polymorphism and opioid addiction, and still others reported a lower risk with the glycine (G) version of the polymorphism.The glycine (G) version of the A118G polymorphism is much more common in certain populations, such as people of Asian or European ancestry, than in others, such as people of African or African American ancestry. These differences may help explain why the results of studies examining its role in opioid addiction have had conflicting results. Researchers suggest that studies with many more people would be needed to confirm an association between this polymorphism and the risk of opioid addiction in any particular population.Common variations in the OPRM1 gene other than A118G have also been associated with opioid addiction in specific populations, such as Han Chinese, European Americans, and African Americans. The A118G polymorphism and other common variations are among many suspected risk factors for opioid addiction. It is likely that a combination of health, social, economic, and lifestyle factors interact with genetic factors to determine an individual's risk of developing this complex disease. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Variations in the OPRM1 gene have been associated with addiction to several additional substances. The μ opioid receptor appears to play a critical role in regulating the pleasure and reward that come from the use of alcohol, nicotine, and certain other drugs of abuse. Although these substances do not interact directly with the μ opioid receptor, they affect the levels of other neurotransmitters in the brain, triggering the body's own endogenous opioids to attach to the receptor. This interaction starts the cascade of chemical signaling in the brain that leads to pain relief and feelings of relaxation and pleasure.As with opioid addiction (described above), most of the research on the connection between the μ opioid receptor and other addictions has focused on the A118G polymorphism. Studies of the effects of this polymorphism on nicotine and alcohol abuse have had inconsistent results, with different studies suggesting an increased risk, a decreased risk, or no effect of having glycine (G) versus alanine (A) at position 118. A person's geographic and ethnic background may be important, and larger studies would be necessary to determine whether a true association exists.Studies have also found associations between the A118G polymorphism and a variety of other traits, including perception of physical and psychological pain, sensitivity to social rejection, a preference for sweet and fatty foods, and how the body responds to stress. It is unclear how this genetic variation causes changes in the brain that influence these traits.Another polymorphism in the OPRM1 gene, usually written as rs540825, is associated with the effectiveness of a drug called citalopram in people with major depressive disorder. This polymorphism changes a single amino acid near one end of the μ opioid receptor. People with major depressive disorder who have this polymorphism are more likely to experience periods without any symptoms (remission) when treated with citalopram than those who do not have the polymorphism.

            "ARID1B\t   The ARID1B gene provides instructions for making a protein that forms one piece (subunit) of several different SWI/SNF protein complexes. SWI/SNF complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed.Through their ability to regulate gene activity, SWI/SNF complexes are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The ARID1B protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.The ARID1B subunit is able to attach (bind) to DNA and is thought to help target SWI/SNF complexes to the chromatin location that needs to be remodeled.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Coffin-Siris syndrome     At least 69 mutations in the ARID1B gene have been found to cause Coffin-Siris syndrome. This condition is characterized by delayed development, abnormalities of the fifth (pinky) fingers or toes, and characteristic facial features that are described as coarse. Most ARID1B gene mutations involved in Coffin-Siris syndrome lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein. As a result, affected individuals have half the normal amount of functional ARID1B protein. Although it is unclear how these changes affect SWI/SNF complexes, researchers suggest that ARID1B gene mutations result in abnormal chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this process alters the activity of many genes and disrupts several cellular processes, which could explain the diverse signs and symptoms of Coffin-Siris syndrome. People with Coffin-Siris syndrome do not appear to have an increased risk of cancer (see below). More About This Health Condition      Autism spectrum disorder     At least 13 ARID1B gene mutations have been identified in people with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a varied condition characterized by impaired social skills, communication problems, and repetitive behaviors. Some affected individuals also have other features, including intellectual disability, severe speech problems, and brain malformations. The ARID1B gene mutations associated with ASD result in a reduced amount of the ARID1B protein or impair the protein's function in chromatin remodeling. These changes likely affect the control of gene expression and interfere with normal brain development, but the specific relationship between the mutations and ASD is unknown. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     Mutations in the ARID1B gene are involved in several types of cancer, including breast cancer, a childhood cancer of nerve tissue called neuroblastoma, and a type of blood cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. These mutations are somatic, which means they are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in tumor cells. The mechanism by which mutations in the ARID1B gene contribute to cancer is unknown, although it is thought that changes in SWI/SNF complexes are involved. These changes may impair normal cell differentiation, which leads to the overgrowth of certain cell types, causing cancer. Alternatively, abnormal SWI/SNF complexes may disrupt the regulation of genes that help control the growth and division of cells, which leads to cancer. It is likely that other genetic changes in addition to ARID1B gene mutations are necessary for cancer development.      Other disorders     Mutations in the ARID1B gene can cause intellectual disability without other hallmark features of Coffin-Siris syndrome (described above). As in Coffin-Siris syndrome, the gene mutations that cause intellectual disability lead to an abnormally short, nonfunctional protein, and affected individuals have half the normal amount of ARID1B protein.

            "ATXN1\t   The ATXN1 gene provides instructions for making a protein called ataxin-1. This protein is found throughout the body, but its function is unknown. Within cells, ataxin-1 is located in the nucleus. Researchers believe that ataxin-1 may be involved in regulating various aspects of producing proteins, including the first stage of protein production (transcription) and processing RNA, a chemical cousin of DNA.One region of the ATXN1 gene contains a DNA segment known as a CAG trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (cytosine, adenine, and guanine) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG segment is repeated 4 to 39 times within the gene.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1     Spinocerebellar ataxia type 1 (SCA1) is a condition characterized by progressive problems with movement. SCA1 results from a mutation in the ATXN1 gene known as a trinucleotide repeat expansion. This mutation increases the length of the repeated CAG segment in the ATXN1 gene. People with SCA1 have from 40 to more than 80 CAG repeats in most cells.The expanded CAG segment leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the ataxin-1 protein that folds into the wrong 3-dimensional shape. This abnormal protein clusters with other proteins to form clumps (aggregates) within the nucleus of cells. These aggregates prevent the ataxin-1 protein from functioning normally, which damages cells. For reasons that are unclear, aggregates of ataxin-1 are found only in the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system). Certain brain cells called Purkinje cells seem to be particularly sensitive to the accumulation of these aggregates. Purkinje cells are located in the part of the brain that coordinates movement (cerebellum) and are involved in chemical signaling between nerve cells (neurons). The accumulation of protein aggregates in the cells of the central nervous system, particularly in Purkinje cells, leads to cell death. Over time, the loss of these cells causes the movement problems characteristic of SCA1.

            "TBP\t   The TBP gene provides instructions for making a protein called the TATA box binding protein.  This protein is active in cells and tissues throughout the body, where it plays an essential role in regulating the activity of most genes.The TATA box binding protein attaches (binds) to a particular sequence of DNA known as the TATA box. This sequence occurs in a regulatory region of DNA near the beginning of many genes. Once the protein is attached to the TATA box near a gene, it acts as a landmark to indicate where other enzymes should start reading the gene. The process of reading a gene's DNA and transferring the information to a similar molecule called mRNA is known as transcription.One region of the TBP gene contains a particular DNA segment known as a CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeat. This segment is made up of a series of three DNA building blocks (nucleotides) that appear multiple times in a row. Normally, the CAG/CAA segment is repeated 25 to 42 times within the gene.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Huntington disease-like syndrome     A particular type of mutation in the TBP gene has been found to cause a progressive brain disorder known as Huntington disease-like 4 (HDL4) or spinocerebellar ataxia type 17 (SCA17). The features of this disorder vary widely among affected individuals. The condition was first described as HDL4 in people whose signs and symptoms closely resembled those of Huntington disease, including uncontrolled movements, emotional problems, and loss of thinking ability. The disorder is now more commonly known as SCA17 because difficulty coordinating movements (ataxia) and other movement problems are the most frequent signs and symptoms.  It is unknown why some people with TBP mutations have a disorder resembling Huntington disease, while others have more prominent ataxia.The mutation associated with HDL4/SCA17 increases the size of the CAG/CAA trinucleotide repeat in the TBP gene. People with this condition have 43 to 66 CAG/CAA repeats. People with 43 to 48 CAG/CAA repeats may or may not have signs and symptoms, while people with 49 or more repeats almost always develop the disorder.An increased number of CAG/CAA repeats in the TBP gene leads to the production of an abnormally long version of the TATA box binding protein. The abnormal protein builds up in nerve cells (neurons) in the brain and disrupts the normal functions of these cells. The dysfunction and eventual death of neurons in certain areas of the brain underlie the signs and symptoms of HDL4/SCA17. Because the TBP gene is active throughout the body, it is unclear why the effects of a mutation in this gene are limited to the brain.

            "HLA-B\t   The HLA-B gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. HLA-B is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.HLA is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. Genes in this complex are categorized into three basic groups:  class I, class II, and class III. In humans, the HLA-B gene and two related genes, HLA-A and HLA-C, are the main genes in MHC class I.MHC class I genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of almost all cells. On the cell surface, these proteins are bound to protein fragments (peptides) that have been exported from within the cell.  MHC class I proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it responds by triggering the infected cell to self-destruct.The HLA-B gene has many possible variations, allowing each person's immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Hundreds of versions (alleles) of the HLA-B gene are known, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-B27). Closely related alleles are categorized together; for example, more than 60 very similar alleles are subtypes of HLA-B27. These subtypes are designated as HLA-B*2701 to HLA-B*2763.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Ankylosing spondylitis     Several variations of the HLA-B gene increase the risk of developing ankylosing spondylitis, particularly a version called HLA-B27. It is uncertain how this variation causes the increased risk. Researchers speculate that HLA-B27 may abnormally display peptides that trigger an immune reaction, resulting in the inflammatory process that causes arthritis.  Other research suggests that the joint inflammation characteristic of this disorder may result from improper folding of the HLA-B27 protein or the presence of abnormal forms of the protein on the cell surface. Although many people with ankylosing spondylitis have the HLA-B27 variation, most people with this version of the HLA-B gene never develop the disorder.  Additional genetic and environmental factors, many of which are unknown, affect the chances of developing ankylosing spondylitis and influence its progression. More About This Health Condition      Behçet disease     Several versions of the HLA-B gene, particularly HLA-B51, are associated with an increased risk of developing Behçet disease, a chronic inflammatory condition that affects many parts of the body. This association is strongest in people from Japan, the Middle East, and other parts of Asia. Researchers do not know how HLA-B51 increases the risk of this disorder. Although many people with Behçet disease have the HLA-B51 variation, most people with this version of the HLA-B gene never develop the condition. It appears likely that other factors, such as viral or bacterial infections and changes in other genes, also influence the development of this complex disorder.

More About This Health Condition      Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis     Several variations of the HLA-B gene have been studied as risk factors for Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN), a potentially life-threatening skin reaction most often triggered by medications. For example, the variation HLA-B*1502 increases the risk of SJS/TEN in people taking certain medications used to treat seizures, particularly a drug called carbamazepine. This version of the gene is most common among people of Han Chinese or southeast Asian descent. Another version of the gene, HLA-B*5801, increases the risk of SJS/TEN in people treated with allopurinol (a drug used to treat kidney stones and gout, which is a form of arthritis caused by a buildup of uric acid in the joints). This association has been confirmed in southeast Asians and in people of non-Asian ancestry, although HLA-B*5801 occurs less frequently in non-Asian populations.Studies suggest that the HLA-B gene variations associated with SJS/TEN cause the immune system to react abnormally to some medications. In a process that is not well understood, the triggering drug causes immune cells called cytotoxic T cells and natural killer (NK) cells to release a substance called granulysin. This substance destroys cells in the skin and mucous membranes, including the lining of the mouth and the airways. The death of these cells causes severe blistering and peeling that can have life-threatening effects.Most people who have variations in the HLA-B gene that are associated with an increased risk of SJS/TEN never develop the condition, even if they are exposed to drugs that can trigger it. Researchers believe that additional genetic and nongenetic factors, many of which are unknown, likely play a role in whether a particular individual develops SJS/TEN. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     The HLA-B27 variant is associated with a group of inflammatory joint diseases related to ankylosing spondylitis. These conditions are known as spondyloarthropathies. Some of these disorders are associated with a common skin condition called psoriasis or with chronic disorders that cause inflammation of the intestinal walls (inflammatory bowel disease). One of the spondyloarthropathies, reactive arthritis, is typically triggered by bacterial infections of the gastrointestinal or genital tract. Following an infection, affected individuals may develop arthritis, back pain, and eye inflammation. Like ankylosing spondylitis, many factors probably contribute to the development of reactive arthritis and other spondyloarthropathies.Among people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, a version of the HLA-B gene designated HLA-B*5701 increases the risk of an adverse reaction (hypersensitivity) to the drug abacavir. This medication slows the spread of the HIV-1 virus in the body. People with abacavir hypersensitivity often develop a fever, chills, rash, upset stomach, and other symptoms when treated with this drug.Several variations of the HLA-B gene appear to play a role in the progression of HIV infection to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is a disease that damages the immune system, preventing it from effectively defending the body against infections. The signs and symptoms of AIDS may not appear until 10 or more years after infection with HIV. Studies suggest that people with HIV infection who have HLA-B27 or HLA-B57 tend to progress more slowly than usual to AIDS. On the other hand, researchers believe that HIV-positive individuals who have HLA-B35 tend to develop the signs and symptoms of AIDS more quickly than usual. Other factors also influence the progression of HIV infection to AIDS.Another version of the HLA-B gene, HLA-B53, has been shown to help protect against severe malaria, a disease caused by a parasite that is carried by mosquitoes. HLA-B53 is most common in West African populations, where malaria is a frequent cause of death in children. Studies suggest that this version of the HLA-B gene may help the immune system respond more effectively to the parasite that causes malaria.

            "MICA\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes the highly polymorphic major histocompatability complex class I chain-related protein A. The protein product is expressed on the cell surface, although unlike canonical class I molecules it does not seem to associate with beta-2-microglobulin. It is a ligand for the NKG2-D type II integral membrane protein receptor. The protein functions as a stress-induced antigen that is broadly recognized by intestinal epithelial gamma delta T cells. Variations in this gene have been associated with susceptibility to psoriasis 1 and psoriatic arthritis, and the shedding of MICA-related antibodies and ligands is involved in the progression from monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance to multiple myeloma. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants. [provided by RefSeq, Jan 2014]From UniProt:Seems to have no role in antigen presentation.

            "CYP21A2\t   The CYP21A2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called 21-hydroxylase, which is part of the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes. Cytochrome P450 enzymes are involved in many processes in the body, such as assisting with reactions that break down drugs and helping to produce cholesterol, certain hormones, and fats (lipids).The 21-hydroxylase enzyme is found in the adrenal glands, which are located on top of the kidneys and produce a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body.  21-hydroxylase plays a role in producing hormones called cortisol and aldosterone.  Cortisol helps maintain blood sugar levels, protects the body from stress, and suppresses inflammation. Aldosterone is sometimes called the salt-retaining hormone because it regulates the amount of salt retained by the kidneys. The retention of salt affects fluid levels in the body and blood pressure.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           21-hydroxylase deficiency     More than 100 mutations in the CYP21A2 gene have been found to cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency.  Some of these mutations result from an exchange of genetic material between the CYP21A2 gene and a similar but nonfunctional piece of DNA called a pseudogene, which is located very close to the CYP21A2 gene on chromosome 6. This type of DNA exchange is called a gene conversion.  The genetic material from the pseudogene contains errors that, when introduced into the CYP21A2 gene, disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make a protein.  Other mutations that cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme or delete or insert pieces of DNA in the CYP21A2 gene.Researchers have described three forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Individuals with a form of the disorder called the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme.  People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme.  Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than any of the other types.  All types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency interfere with the production of cortisol and aldosterone.  The substances that are usually used to form these hormones instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens, which are male sex hormones.  The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

This type of DNA exchange is called a gene conversion.  The genetic material from the pseudogene contains errors that, when introduced into the CYP21A2 gene, disrupt the way the gene's instructions are used to make a protein.  Other mutations that cause 21-hydroxylase deficiency change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the 21-hydroxylase enzyme or delete or insert pieces of DNA in the CYP21A2 gene.Researchers have described three forms of 21-hydroxylase deficiency. Individuals with a form of the disorder called the salt-wasting type have CYP21A2 mutations that result in a completely nonfunctional enzyme.  People with the simple virilizing type of this condition have CYP21A2 gene mutations that allow the production of low levels of functional enzyme.  Individuals with the non-classic type of this disorder have CYP21A2 mutations that result in the production of reduced amounts of the enzyme, but more enzyme than any of the other types.  All types of 21-hydroxylase deficiency interfere with the production of cortisol and aldosterone.  The substances that are usually used to form these hormones instead build up in the adrenal glands and are converted to androgens, which are male sex hormones.  The excess production of androgens leads to abnormalities of sexual development in people with 21-hydroxylase deficiency.

            "TNXB\t   The TNXB gene provides instructions for making a protein called tenascin-X. This protein plays an important role in organizing and maintaining the structure of tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin (connective tissues). In particular, studies suggest that it helps to regulate the production and assembly of certain types of collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support connective tissues throughout the body. Tenascin-X is also involved in regulating the structure and stability of elastic fibers, which provide flexibility and stretchiness (elasticity) to connective tissues.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Ehlers-Danlos syndrome     Mutations in the TNXB gene cause a very small percentage of all cases of a form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome called the hypermobile type. Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. The hypermobile type is characterized by an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). The mutations that cause this form of the disorder occur in one copy of the TNXB gene in each cell. These mutations reduce the amount of functional tenascin-X that cells produce, which decreases the ability of tenascin-X to interact with collagens and elastic fibers. These changes weaken connective tissues in many parts of the body, which results in the signs and symptoms of the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.Some people with a condition called benign joint hypermobility syndrome (BJHS) also make a reduced amount of tenascin-X protein, although no TNXB gene mutations have been identified in these individuals. This condition causes hypermobility and chronic joint pain. The signs and symptoms of benign joint hypermobility syndrome overlap significantly with those of the hypermobile type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Studies suggest that they may be forms of the same condition.Some people with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome have mutations in two copies of the TNXB gene in each cell. These individuals have a form of the disorder that is often called the classical-like type. Its signs and symptoms are similar to the classical type of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, including hypermobility and skin that is soft, highly stretchy (elastic), and fragile. However, affected individuals do not have the unusual scarring that is characteristic of that type. Mutations that occur in both copies of the TNXB gene prevent production of any tenascin-X protein. A loss of this protein severely disrupts the organization of collagen fibrils and elastic fibers, which significantly weakens connective tissues.

Members of this Type I transmembrane protein family share structural characteristics including an extracellular domain consisting of multiple epidermal growth factor-like (EGF) repeats, and an intracellular domain consisting of multiple different domain types. Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved intercellular signaling pathway that regulates interactions between physically adjacent cells through binding of Notch family receptors to their cognate ligands. The encoded preproprotein is proteolytically processed in the trans-Golgi network to generate two polypeptide chains that heterodimerize to form the mature cell-surface receptor. This receptor may play a role in vascular, renal and hepatic development. Mutations in this gene may be associated with schizophrenia. Alternative splicing results in multiple transcript variants, at least one of which encodes an isoform that is proteolytically processed.

            "HLA-DRA\t   From NCBI Gene:HLA-DRA is one of the HLA class II alpha chain paralogues. This class II molecule is a heterodimer consisting of an alpha and a beta chain, both anchored in the membrane. It plays a central role in the immune system by presenting peptides derived from extracellular proteins. Class II molecules are expressed in antigen presenting cells (APC: B lymphocytes, dendritic cells, macrophages). The alpha chain is approximately 33-35 kDa and its gene contains 5 exons. Exon 1 encodes the leader peptide, exons 2 and 3 encode the two extracellular domains, and exon 4 encodes the transmembrane domain and the cytoplasmic tail. DRA does not have polymorphisms in the peptide binding part and acts as the sole alpha chain for DRB1, DRB3, DRB4 and DRB5.

The peptide binding cleft accommodates peptides of 10-30 residues. The peptides presented by MHC class II molecules are generated mostly by degradation of proteins that access the endocytic route, where they are processed by lysosomal proteases and other hydrolases. Exogenous antigens that have been endocytosed by the APC are thus readily available for presentation via MHC II molecules, and for this reason this antigen presentation pathway is usually referred to as exogenous. As membrane proteins on their way to degradation in lysosomes as part of their normal turn-over are also contained in the endosomal/lysosomal compartments, exogenous antigens must compete with those derived from endogenous components. Autophagy is also a source of endogenous peptides, autophagosomes constitutively fuse with MHC class II loading compartments. In addition to APCs, other cells of the gastrointestinal tract, such as epithelial cells, express MHC class II molecules and CD74 and act as APCs, which is an unusual trait of the GI tract. To produce a MHC class II molecule that presents an antigen, three MHC class II molecules (heterodimers of an alpha and a beta chain) associate with a CD74 trimer in the ER to form a heterononamer. Soon after the entry of this complex into the endosomal/lysosomal system where antigen processing occurs, CD74 undergoes a sequential degradation by various proteases, including CTSS and CTSL, leaving a small fragment termed CLIP (class-II-associated invariant chain peptide). The removal of CLIP is facilitated by HLA-DM via direct binding to the alpha-beta-CLIP complex so that CLIP is released. HLA-DM stabilizes MHC class II molecules until primary high affinity antigenic peptides are bound. The MHC II molecule bound to a peptide is then transported to the cell membrane surface. In B-cells, the interaction between HLA-DM and MHC class II molecules is regulated by HLA-DO. Primary dendritic cells (DCs) also to express HLA-DO.

            "HLA-DRB1\t   The HLA-DRB1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DRB1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. The HLA-DRB1 gene belongs to a group of MHC genes called MHC class II. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of certain immune system cells. These proteins attach to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. MHC class II proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.The protein produced from the HLA-DRB1 gene, called the beta chain, attaches (binds) to another protein called the alpha chain, which is produced from the HLA-DRA gene. Together, they form a functional protein complex called the HLA-DR antigen-binding heterodimer. This complex displays foreign peptides to the immune system to trigger the body's immune response.Each MHC class II gene has many possible variations, allowing the immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Researchers have identified hundreds of different versions (alleles) of the HLA-DRB1 gene, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-DRB1*04:01).

More About This Health Condition      Autoimmune Addison disease     Certain variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene have been linked to an increased risk of developing an autoimmune disorder called autoimmune Addison disease. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. In autoimmune Addison disease, the immune system attacks the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. Loss of hormones produced by the adrenal glands leads to the features of the condition, which include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, low blood pressure (hypotension), and abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction such as the armpits, elbows, and knuckles. A particular HLA-DRB1 gene variant called HLA-DRB1*04:04 is the most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease.Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein; in about 85 percent of people with autoimmune Addison disease, the protein is 21-hydroxylase. 21-hydroxylase is found in the adrenal glands where it plays a key role in producing a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to the diverse features of autoimmune Addison disease. It is not clear how HLA-DRB1*04:04 and other HLA-DRB1 variations are involved in the inappropriate immune response that causes autoimmune Addison disease.

More About This Health Condition      Multiple sclerosis     Variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene have been associated with an increased risk of developing multiple sclerosis. This condition affects the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system), causing muscle weakness, poor coordination, numbness, and a variety of other health problems. One variant of this gene, called HLA-DRB1*15:01, is the most strongly linked genetic factor for the risk of multiple sclerosis.Because the HLA-DRB1 gene is involved in the immune system, changes in it might be related to the autoimmune response and inflammation that damage nerves and the protective coating surrounding them (the myelin sheath), leading to the signs and symptoms of multiple sclerosis. However, it is unclear exactly what role HLA-DRB1 gene variants play in development of multiple sclerosis. A combination of genetic and environmental factors is likely involved in this condition.

More About This Health Condition      Rheumatoid arthritis     Several common variations of the HLA-DRB1 gene are associated with a person's risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. This disease causes chronic abnormal inflammation that primarily affects the joints. HLA-DRB1 is one of several genes in the HLA complex that have been associated with rheumatoid arthritis; variations of this gene are the most significant known genetic risk factor for the disease.The HLA-DRB1 gene variations associated with an increased risk of rheumatoid arthritis affect single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the beta chain. These changes occur near the antigen-recognizing binding groove, which is the part of the protein that attaches (binds) to viral or bacterial peptides. This binding triggers the immune response that attacks foreign invaders. Although the mechanism by which HLA-DRB1 gene variations increase the risk of rheumatoid arthritis is unclear, researchers suspect it is related to changes in peptide binding that stimulate an abnormal immune response. However, many other genetic and environmental factors also contribute to a person's overall risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.A few variations of the HLA-DRB1 gene appear to decrease the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis. It is unclear why these particular changes may be protective. More About This Health Condition      Rosacea     Genetics Home Reference provides information about rosacea. More About This Health Condition      Type 1 diabetes     Combinations of variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene and other HLA genes affect the risk of type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin and is caused by autoimmune damage to insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.Type 1 diabetes risk is most increased by two specific combinations of variations of the HLA-DRB1 gene and other HLA genes called HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1. Combinations of HLA gene variants are called HLA haplotypes. One haplotype, written as DRB1*03:01-DQA1*05:01-DQB1*02, is called DR3. The other haplotype, written as DRB1*04:01/02/04/05/08-DQA1*03:01-DQB1*02, is called DR4. People at highest risk of developing type 1 diabetes have one copy of the DR3 haplotype and one copy of the DR4 haplotype in each cell. Other HLA haplotypes only mildly increase the risk of type 1 diabetes, while some haplotypes seem to protect against developing this condition. Variations in other genes and environmental factors are also thought to affect the risk of this complex disorder. More About This Health Condition      Autoimmune disorders     Normal variations of the HLA-DRB1 gene have been associated with many other autoimmune disorders, including pemphigus, sarcoidosis, and others listed on this page. Pemphigus is a condition that causes severe blistering of the skin and mucous membranes (such as the moist lining of the mouth). Sarcoidosis is a disorder in which inflammation occurs in many organs and tissues of the body.It is unclear how different versions of the HLA-DRB1 gene influence the risk of developing autoimmune disorders. These disorders typically result from a combination of multiple environmental and genetic factors. Changes in other HLA and non-HLA genes, some of which remain unknown, also likely contribute to the risk of developing these complex conditions.

More About This Health Condition  Certain variations in the HLA-DRB1 gene have been linked to an increased risk of developing an autoimmune disorder called autoimmune Addison disease. Autoimmune disorders occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's tissues and organs. In autoimmune Addison disease, the immune system attacks the adrenal glands, which are small hormone-producing glands located on top of each kidney. Loss of hormones produced by the adrenal glands leads to the features of the condition, which include extreme tiredness (fatigue), nausea, low blood pressure (hypotension), and abnormally dark areas of skin (hyperpigmentation), especially in regions that experience a lot of friction such as the armpits, elbows, and knuckles. A particular HLA-DRB1 gene variant called HLA-DRB1*04:04 is the most well-known risk factor for autoimmune Addison disease.Normally, the immune system responds only to proteins made by foreign invaders, not to the body's own proteins. In autoimmune Addison disease, however, an immune response is triggered by a normal adrenal gland protein; in about 85 percent of people with autoimmune Addison disease, the protein is 21-hydroxylase. 21-hydroxylase is found in the adrenal glands where it plays a key role in producing a variety of hormones that regulate many essential functions in the body. The prolonged immune attack triggered by 21-hydroxylase damages the adrenal glands (specifically the outer layers of the glands known, collectively, as the adrenal cortex), preventing hormone production. A shortage of adrenal hormones (adrenal insufficiency) disrupts several normal functions in the body, leading to the diverse features of autoimmune Addison disease. It is not clear how HLA-DRB1*04:04 and other HLA-DRB1 variations are involved in the inappropriate immune response that causes autoimmune Addison disease.

            "HLA-DQA1\t   The HLA-DQA1 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays a critical role in the immune system. The HLA-DQA1 gene is part of a family of genes called the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) complex. The HLA complex helps the immune system distinguish the body's own proteins from proteins made by foreign invaders such as viruses and bacteria.The HLA complex is the human version of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC), a gene family that occurs in many species. The HLA-DQA1 gene belongs to a group of MHC genes called MHC class II. MHC class II genes provide instructions for making proteins that are present on the surface of certain immune system cells. These proteins attach to protein fragments (peptides) outside the cell. MHC class II proteins display these peptides to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the peptides as foreign (such as viral or bacterial peptides), it triggers a response to attack the invading viruses or bacteria.The protein produced from the HLA-DQA1 gene attaches (binds) to the protein produced from another MHC class II gene, HLA-DQB1. Together, they form a functional protein complex called an antigen-binding DQαβ heterodimer. This complex displays foreign peptides to the immune system to trigger the body's immune response.Each MHC class II gene has many possible variations, allowing the immune system to react to a wide range of foreign invaders. Researchers have identified hundreds of different versions (alleles) of the HLA-DQA1 gene, each of which is given a particular number (such as HLA-DQA1*05:01).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Celiac disease     At least two specific combinations of HLA gene variants (HLA haplotypes) have been found to increase the risk of developing celiac disease, a disorder in which inflammation damages the intestinal tract and other organs and tissues. One of these haplotypes, known as DQ2, is composed of the protein produced from HLA-DQA1 gene variants known as HLA-DQA1*05:01 or HLA-DQA1*05:05 bound to the protein produced from HLA-DQB1 gene variants known as HLA-DQB1*02:01 or HLA-DQB1*02:02. The other haplotype, known as DQ8, is composed of the protein produced from  HLA-DQA1 gene variants known as HLA-DQA1*03:01 or HLA-DQA1*03:02 bound to the protein produced from the HLA-DQB1 gene variant known as HLA-DQB1*03:02.The DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes, which may occur separately or together, seem to increase the risk of an inappropriate immune response to the protein gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, and barley. This immune system malfunction results in the damage to the body's organs and tissues that occurs in celiac disease.  However, the DQ2 and DQ8 haplotypes are also found in 30 percent of the general population, and only 3 percent of individuals with these haplotypes develop celiac disease.

Type 1 diabetes is characterized by high blood sugar levels resulting from a shortage of the hormone insulin and is caused by autoimmune damage to insulin-producing cells in the pancreas.Type 1 diabetes risk is most increased by two HLA haplotypes involving variations of the HLA-DQA1 and HLA-DQB1 genes and another HLA gene called HLA-DRB1.

Other HLA haplotypes only mildly increase the risk of type 1 diabetes, while some haplotypes seem to protect against developing this condition. Variations in other genes and environmental factors are also thought to affect the risk of this complex disorder. More About This Health Condition      Autoimmune disorders     Certain normal variations of the HLA-DQA1 gene have been associated with increased risk of autoimmune disorders, which occur when the immune system malfunctions and attacks the body's own tissues and organs. It is unclear how different versions of the HLA-DQA1 gene influence the risk of developing autoimmune disorders. These conditions are thought to result from a combination of multiple environmental and genetic factors. Changes in other HLA and non-HLA genes, some of which remain unknown, also likely contribute to the risk of developing these complex conditions.      Other disorders     Normal variations in the HLA-DQA1 gene can affect the body's ability to recognize and react to foreign invaders (pathogens). For example, variations of this gene have been shown to increase or decrease a person's chance of getting infections such as hepatitis B and leprosy or may affect the severity of illness if infection occurs.A particular variant of the HLA-DQA1 gene known as HLA-DQA1*02:01 increases the risk of liver damage in women with advanced breast cancer treated with a drug called lapatinib. Researchers suggest that the variant may increase immune system sensitivity to the drug, resulting in inflammation that damages the liver.

            "TAP2\t   The TAP2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an important role in the immune system. The TAP2 protein assembles with another protein called TAP1 (produced from the TAP1 gene) to form a protein complex called the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) complex. This complex, which is found in the membrane of a cell structure called the endoplasmic reticulum, moves (transports) protein fragments (peptides) from foreign invaders into the endoplasmic reticulum. There, the peptides are attached to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I proteins. The peptide-bound MHC class I proteins are then moved to the surface of the cell so that specialized immune system cells can interact with them. When these immune system cells recognize the peptides as harmful, they launch an immune response to get rid of the foreign invaders.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Bare lymphocyte syndrome type I     At least seven mutations in the TAP2 gene have been found to cause bare lymphocyte syndrome type I (BLS I). This immune system disorder often causes recurrent bacterial infections in the respiratory tract and open sores (ulcers) on the skin, although some people with BLS I have no symptoms of the condition. TAP2 gene mutations involved in BLS I prevent production of functional TAP2 protein. Absence of functional TAP2 impairs the formation of the TAP complex, without which peptides from foreign invaders cannot be transported into the endoplasmic reticulum and attached to MHC class I proteins. Consequently, MHC class I proteins are broken down, which results in a shortage of these proteins on the surface of cells. A lack of MHC class I proteins impairs the body's immune response to bacteria, leading to recurrent bacterial infections. Researchers are unsure why people with BLS I do not also get viral infections, but they suspect that other immune processes are able to recognize and fight viruses. It is also not clear how TAP2 gene mutations are involved in the development of skin ulcers.

            "COL11A2\t   The COL11A2 gene provides instructions for making a component of type XI collagen called the pro-alpha2(XI) chain. Collagens are molecules that provide structure and strength to the connective tissues that support the body's muscles, joints, organs, and skin. Type XI collagen is normally found in cartilage, a tough but flexible tissue that makes up much of the skeleton during early development. Most cartilage is later converted to bone, except for the cartilage that continues to cover and protect the ends of bones and is present in the nose and external ears. Type XI collagen made with the pro-alpha2(XI) chain is also part of the inner ear and the nucleus pulposus, which is the center portion of the discs between the bones of the spine (vertebrae).Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. The pro-alpha2(XI) chain combines with two other collagen chains, pro-alpha1(XI) and pro-alpha1(II), to form a triple-stranded procollagen molecule. Then the ropelike procollagen is processed by enzymes to create mature collagen. Mature collagen molecules arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils that form stable interactions (cross-links) with one another in the spaces between cells (the extracellular matrix). The cross-links result in the formation of very strong type XI collagen fibers.Type XI collagen also helps maintain the spacing and width (diameter) of another type of collagen molecule, type II collagen. Type II collagen is an important component of mature cartilage. The arrangement and size of type II collagen fibrils is essential for the normal structure of these tissues.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Fibrochondrogenesis     At least two mutations in the COL11A2 gene have been identified in people with fibrochondrogenesis type 2, a disorder of bone growth characterized by severe skeletal abnormalities and hearing loss. Infants with fibrochondrogenesis type 2 have a very narrow chest that prevents the lungs from developing normally. Most infants with this condition are stillborn or die shortly after birth from respiratory failure, although some have lived into childhood.The COL11A2 gene mutations that cause fibrochondrogenesis type 2 lead to the production of an abnormal version of the pro-alpha2(XI) chain. When this abnormal chain is incorporated into collagen molecules, it creates defective type XI collagen. The abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues, impairing the formation of bones throughout the skeleton and causing changes in the inner ear that lead to hearing problems. More About This Health Condition      Nonsyndromic hearing loss     Mutations in the COL11A2 gene have been identified in people with nonsyndromic hearing loss, which is loss of hearing that is not associated with other signs and symptoms. Mutations in this gene can cause two forms of nonsyndromic hearing loss: DFNA13 and DFNB53.DFNA13 is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means only one mutated copy of the COL11A2 gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the condition. This type of hearing loss begins in childhood or adolescence. It is classified as postlingual because it starts after a child learns to speak.At least two COL11A2 gene mutations have been identified in people with DFNA13. Both of these mutations change a single protein building block (amino acid) in the pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen. These mutations are thought to change the structure of type XI collagen, which plays an important role in the structure and function of the inner ear.DFNB53 is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the COL11A2 gene are mutated in each cell. It is characterized by profound hearing loss that is present before a child learns to speak (prelingual).At least three mutations in the COL11A2 gene have been found to cause DFNB53. Each of these mutations changes a single amino acid in the pro-alpha2(XI) chain of type XI collagen. Studies suggest that the altered protein causes hearing loss by changing the structure of type XI collagen and impairing its ability to interact with other proteins. More About This Health Condition      Otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia     At least 14 mutations in the COL11A2 gene have been found to cause otospondylomegaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED), a disorder characterized by skeletal abnormalities, distinctive facial features, and severe hearing loss. These signs and symptoms are similar to those of Weissenbacher-Zweymüller syndrome (described below) and to a form of Stickler syndrome classified as type III. In some cases, it can be difficult to tell these conditions apart. Some researchers believe they represent a single disorder with a range of signs and symptoms.Most of the reported COL11A2 gene mutations that cause OSMED lead to the production of an abnormally short version of the pro-alpha2(XI) chain that is probably not incorporated into type XI collagen molecules. The defective collagen impairs the normal development of several tissues, including bones and the inner ear.

            "F13A1\t   The F13A1 gene provides instructions for making one part, the A subunit, of a protein called factor XIII. This protein is part of a group of related proteins called coagulation factors that are essential for normal blood clotting. They work together as part of the coagulation cascade, which is a series of chemical reactions that forms blood clots in response to injury. After an injury, clots seal off blood vessels to stop bleeding and trigger blood vessel repair. Factor XIII acts at the end of the cascade to strengthen and stabilize newly formed clots, preventing further blood loss.Factor XIII in the bloodstream is made of two A subunits (produced from the F13A1 gene) and two B subunits (produced from the F13B gene). When a new blood clot forms, the A and B subunits separate from one another, and the A subunit is cut (cleaved) to produce the active form of factor XIII (factor XIIIa). The active protein links together molecules of fibrin, the material that forms the clot, which strengthens the clot and keeps other molecules from breaking it down.Studies suggest that factor XIII has additional functions, although these are less well understood than its role in blood clotting. Specifically, factor XIII is likely involved in other aspects of wound healing, immune system function, maintaining pregnancy, bone formation, and the growth of new blood vessels (angiogenesis).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Factor XIII deficiency     At least 140 mutations in the F13A1 gene have been found to cause inherited factor XIII deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder. Without treatment, affected individuals have a greatly increased risk of abnormal bleeding episodes, including life-threatening bleeding inside the skull (intracranial hemorrhage). F13A1 gene mutations severely reduce the amount or activity of the A subunit of factor XIII. In most people with these mutations, the level of functional factor XIII in the bloodstream is less than 5 percent of normal. This loss of factor XIII activity weakens new blood clots and prevents them from stopping blood loss effectively. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Several common variations (polymorphisms) in the F13A1 gene have been studied as possible risk factors for diseases involving abnormal blood clotting. The most common F13A1 gene polymorphism changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in a critical part of the A subunit, replacing the amino acid valine with the amino acid leucine at protein position 34 (written as Val34Leu or V34L). This genetic change speeds up the activation of factor XIII. The Val34Leu polymorphism has been studied in relation to heart disease, stroke, recurrent pregnancy loss, and several other conditions. However, the results of these studies have been conflicting, and it remains unclear whether the polymorphism represents a major risk factor for any of these conditions.

            "KHDC3L\t   The KHDC3L gene provides instructions for making a protein whose role is not known. The KHDC3L protein is thought to be involved in regulating gene activity (expression) through a phenomenon known as genomic imprinting. Through genomic imprinting, certain genes are turned off (inactivated) based on which parent the copy of the gene came from. For most genes, both copies of the gene (one copy inherited from each parent) are active in all cells. However, for a small subset of genes, only one of the two copies is active and the other is turned off. For some of these genes, the copy from the father is normally active, while for others, the copy from the mother is normally active.It is likely that the KHDC3L protein has additional roles in egg cell (oocyte) and embryonic development; however, its exact functions are unclear.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Recurrent hydatidiform mole     At least six mutations in the KHDC3L gene have been found to cause a pregnancy-related condition known as recurrent hydatidiform mole. A hydatidiform mole is a mass that forms early in pregnancy and is made up of cells from an abnormally developed embryo and placenta. The placenta, a structure in the uterus that normally provides nutrients to a growing fetus, is dysfunctional and appears as numerous small sacs, often described as resembling a bunch of grapes. When a hydatidiform mole develops more than once, the condition is known as recurrent hydatidiform mole. KHDC3L gene mutations account for recurrent hydatidiform mole in about 5 percent of women with this condition.KHDC3L gene mutations result in the production of a protein with reduced function. As a result, oocytes do not develop normally. A pregnancy that results from an abnormal oocyte cannot develop properly, resulting in recurrent hydatidiform mole. KHDC3L gene mutations can also prevent proper imprinting of multiple genes that contribute to a developing embryo, leading to abnormal gene activity (expression).

            "RELN\t   The RELN gene provides instructions for making a protein called reelin. This protein is produced in the brain both before and after birth. Reelin is released by certain brain cells; then it attaches (binds) to specific receptor proteins. In the developing brain, this binding turns on (activates) a signaling pathway that triggers nerve cells (neurons) to migrate to their proper locations.After birth, reelin likely plays a role in many brain processes, including the extension of axons and dendrites, which are specialized outgrowths from nerve cells that are essential for the transmission of nerve impulses. Reelin may also regulate synaptic plasticity, which is the ability of connections between neurons (synapses) to change and adapt over time in response to experience. Additionally, reelin controls the release of chemicals that relay signals in the nervous system (neurotransmitters).     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia     At least six mutations in the RELN gene have been found to cause lissencephaly with cerebellar hypoplasia (LCH). This condition affects brain development, resulting in the brain having a smooth appearance (lissencephaly) instead of its normal folds and grooves. In addition, the brain region involved in coordinating movements is unusually small and underdeveloped (cerebellar hypoplasia). The RELN gene mutations that cause LCH lead to a complete lack of reelin. As a result, the signaling pathway that triggers neuronal migration is not activated. Without reelin, neurons are disorganized, the normal folds and grooves of the brain do not form, and brain structures do not develop properly.  This impairment of brain development leads to intellectual disability, delayed overall development, movement problems, and other signs and symptoms of LCH.

Women with these polymorphisms are at particular risk of developing bipolar disease. In addition, certain genetic changes that result in a decrease in production of reelin (but not a complete absence) may be a risk factor for autism spectrum disorder, which affects communication and social interaction.

            "IRF5\t   The protein produced from the IRF5 gene, called interferon regulatory factor 5 (IRF5), acts as a transcription factor, which means that it attaches (binds) to specific regions of DNA and helps control the activity of certain genes. When a virus is recognized in the cell, the IRF5 gene is turned on (activated), which leads to the production of IRF5 protein. The protein binds to specific regions of DNA that regulate the activity of genes that produce interferons and other cytokines. Cytokines are proteins that help fight infection by promoting inflammation and regulating the activity of immune system cells. In particular, interferons control the activity of genes that help block the replication of viruses, and they stimulate the activity of certain immune system cells known as natural killer cells.

            "CLCN1\t   The CLCN1 gene belongs to the CLC family of genes, which provide instructions for making chloride channels. These channels, which transport negatively charged chlorine atoms (chloride ions), play a key role in a cell's ability to generate and transmit electrical signals. Some CLC channels regulate the flow of chloride ions across cell membranes, while others transport chloride ions within cells.The CLCN1 gene provides instructions for making a chloride channel called ClC-1.  These channels are abundant in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). For the body to move normally, skeletal muscles must tense (contract) and relax in a coordinated way. Muscle contraction and relaxation are controlled by the flow of certain ions into and out of muscle cells. ClC-1 channels, which span the cell membrane, control the flow of chloride ions into these cells.  This influx stabilizes the cells' electrical charge, which prevents muscles from contracting abnormally.ClC-1 channels are made of two identical protein subunits, each produced from the CLCN1 gene. Although each subunit forms a separate opening (pore) that allows chloride ions to pass through, the two proteins work together to regulate the flow of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Myotonia congenita     More than 80 mutations in the CLCN1 gene have been identified in people with myotonia congenita. Most of these mutations cause the autosomal recessive form of the disorder, which is known as Becker disease. Autosomal recessive inheritance means two copies of the gene in each cell are altered. Becker disease results when CLCN1 mutations change the structure or function of both protein subunits that make up the ClC-1 channel. The altered channels greatly reduce the flow of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells, which triggers prolonged muscle contractions.  Abnormally sustained muscle contractions are the hallmark of myotonia.CLCN1 mutations also cause the autosomal dominant form of myotonia congenita, which is known as Thomsen disease. Autosomal dominant inheritance means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the disorder. Studies suggest that the CLCN1 mutations responsible for Thomsen disease change one of the two protein subunits that make up the ClC-1 channel. The altered protein takes on new, but harmful, properties that disrupt the ability of both subunits to regulate chloride ion flow. Reduced movement of chloride ions into skeletal muscle cells leads to myotonia, which underlies the stiffness and other muscle problems in people with myotonia congenita.Because several CLCN1 mutations can cause either Becker disease or Thomsen disease, doctors usually rely on characteristic signs and symptoms to distinguish the two forms of myotonia congenita.

Members of this gene family, which also includes the MFNG (GeneID: 4242) and RFNG (GeneID: 5986) genes, encode evolutionarily conserved glycosyltransferases that act in the Notch signaling pathway to define boundaries during embryonic development. While their genomic structure is distinct from other glycosyltransferases, these proteins have a fucose-specific beta-1,3-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase activity that leads to elongation of O-linked fucose residues on Notch, which alters Notch signaling. The protein encoded by this gene is predicted to be a single-pass type II Golgi membrane protein but it may also be secreted and proteolytically processed like the related proteins in mouse and Drosophila (PMID: 9187150).

            "PMS2\t   The PMS2 gene provides instructions for making a protein that plays an essential role in repairing DNA. This protein helps fix errors that are made when DNA is copied (DNA replication) in preparation for cell division. The PMS2 protein joins with another protein called MLH1 (produced from the MLH1 gene) to form a protein complex. This complex coordinates the activities of other proteins that repair errors made during DNA replication. Repairs are made by removing the section of DNA that contains errors and replacing it with a corrected DNA sequence. The PMS2 gene is a member of a set of genes known as the mismatch repair (MMR) genes.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Lynch syndrome     Mutations in the PMS2 gene have been reported in about 2 percent of families with Lynch syndrome that have an identified gene mutation. Lynch syndrome increases the risk of many types of cancer, particularly cancers of the colon (large intestine) and rectum, which are collectively referred to as colorectal cancer. People with Lynch syndrome also have an increased risk of cancers of the endometrium (lining of the uterus), ovaries, stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder duct, upper urinary tract, and brain. PMS2 gene mutations involved in this condition lead to the production of an abnormally short or inactive PMS2 protein that cannot efficiently repair errors made during DNA replication. The errors accumulate as the cells continue to divide, which may cause the cells to function abnormally, increasing the risk of tumor formation in the colon or another part of the body.Some mutations in the PMS2 gene can cause a variant of Lynch syndrome called Turcot syndrome. In addition to colorectal cancer, people with Turcot syndrome tend to develop a particular type of brain tumor called a glioblastoma.

More About This Health Condition      Other cancers     While Lynch syndrome is associated with a mutation in one copy of the PMS2 gene, very rarely, individuals in affected families inherit two PMS2 gene mutations, one from each parent. Most often in these cases, the same mutation occurs in both copies of the gene (a homozygous mutation). People with a homozygous PMS2 gene mutation have a syndrome distinct from Lynch syndrome. In addition to colorectal cancer, these individuals may develop cancers of the blood (leukemia or lymphoma). Some of these individuals will also develop characteristic features of a condition known as neurofibromatosis, including noncancerous tumors that grow along nerves (neurofibromas) and light brown patches of skin called café-au-lait spots. The onset of colon cancer in these individuals is extremely early, often occurring during childhood.

Since thrombospondins are widely distributed proteins involved in a variety of adhesive processes, this protein may have important functions as a cell adhesion molecule. It binds to collagen, thrombospondin, anionic phospholipids and oxidized LDL. It directly mediates cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and it binds long chain fatty acids and may function in the transport and/or as a regulator of fatty acid transport. Mutations in this gene cause platelet glycoprotein deficiency. Multiple alternatively spliced transcript variants have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Feb 2014]From UniProt:Multifunctional glycoprotein that acts as receptor for a broad range of ligands. Ligands can be of proteinaceous nature like thrombospondin, fibronectin, collagen or amyloid-beta as well as of lipidic nature such as oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), anionic phospholipids, long-chain fatty acids and bacterial diacylated lipopeptides. They are generally multivalent and can therefore engage multiple receptors simultaneously, the resulting formation of CD36 clusters initiates signal transduction and internalization of receptor-ligand complexes. The dependency on coreceptor signaling is strongly ligand specific. Cellular responses to these ligands are involved in angiogenesis, inflammatory response, fatty acid metabolism, taste and dietary fat processing in the intestine (Probable). Binds long-chain fatty acids and facilitates their transport into cells, thus participating in muscle lipid utilization, adipose energy storage, and gut fat absorption (By similarity) (PubMed:18353783, PubMed:21610069). In the small intestine, plays a role in proximal absorption of dietary fatty acid and cholesterol for optimal chylomicron formation, possibly through the activation of MAPK1/3 (ERK1/2) signaling pathway (By similarity) (PubMed:18753675). Involved in oral fat perception and preferences (PubMed:22240721, PubMed:25822988). Detection into the tongue of long-chain fatty acids leads to a rapid and sustained rise in flux and protein content of pancreatobiliary secretions (By similarity). In taste receptor cells, mediates the induction of an increase in intracellular calcium levels by long-chain fatty acids, leading to the activation of the gustatory neurons in the nucleus of the solitary tract (By similarity). Important factor in both ventromedial hypothalamus neuronal sensing of long-chain fatty acid and the regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis (By similarity). Receptor for thombospondins, THBS1 and THBS2, mediating their antiangiogenic effects (By similarity). As a coreceptor for TLR4:TLR6 heterodimer, promotes inflammation in monocytes/macrophages. Upon ligand binding, such as oxLDL or amyloid-beta 42, interacts with the heterodimer TLR4:TLR6, the complex is internalized and triggers inflammatory response, leading to NF-kappa-B-dependent production of CXCL1, CXCL2 and CCL9 cytokines, via MYD88 signaling pathway, and CCL5 cytokine, via TICAM1 signaling pathway, as well as IL1B secretion, through the priming and activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome (By similarity) (PubMed:20037584). Selective and nonredundant sensor of microbial diacylated lipopeptide that signal via TLR2:TLR6 heterodimer, this cluster triggers signaling from the cell surface, leading to the NF-kappa-B-dependent production of TNF, via MYD88 signaling pathway and subsequently is targeted to the Golgi in a lipid-raft dependent pathway (By similarity) (PubMed:16880211).(Microbial infection) Directly mediates cytoadherence of Plasmodium falciparum parasitized erythrocytes and the internalization of particles independently of TLR signaling.

            "VPS13B\t   Researchers are still working to determine the exact role of the VPS13B gene (also called the COH1 gene) in the human body. Studies show that the protein produced from this gene is a part of the Golgi apparatus, which is a cell structure in which newly produced proteins are modified so they can carry out their functions. In particular, the VPS13B protein is involved in a modification called glycosylation, which is the attachment of sugar molecules to proteins. The VPS13B protein also appears to be involved in the sorting and transporting of proteins inside the cell.Studies suggest several functions for the VPS13B protein in the body. The protein appears to play an important role in the normal growth and development of nerve cells (neurons). It may also be involved in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy, and may play a role in the storage and distribution of fats in the body.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Cohen syndrome     More than 150 different mutations in the VPS13B gene have been found in individuals with Cohen syndrome. Individuals with this condition typically have intellectual disability, eye problems, and distinctive facial features. Another common feature of the condition is obesity, particularly around the torso but not the arms and legs (truncal obesity). Most of the mutations that cause Cohen syndrome result in a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the VPS13B protein. Researchers believe that this genetic change leads to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. Studies suggest that a loss of this protein's function disrupts the organization of the Golgi apparatus and impairs normal glycosylation. However, it is not known how the absence of functional VPS13B protein or these cellular changes lead to the signs and symptoms of Cohen syndrome. Researchers speculate that problems with neuron development underlie intellectual disability, eye problems and other features of Cohen syndrome. Abnormal fat storage may cause truncal obesity in people with the condition.In the Finnish population, 75 percent of individuals with Cohen syndrome have a mutation in both copies of the VPS13B gene that deletes two DNA building blocks (base pairs). This mutation is sometimes written as 3348_3349delCT. The deletion causes a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the VPS13B protein.Two common mutations occur in the Old Order Amish population. The first mutation adds one base pair and is sometimes written as 9258_9259insT. This mutation creates a premature stop signal in the instructions for making the VPS13B protein. The second mutation changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the VPS13B protein. Specifically, this mutation replaces the amino acid isoleucine with the amino acid threonine at position 2820 (written as Ile2820Thr or I2820T).

            "RRM2B\t   The RRM2B gene provides instructions for making one piece, called the p53 inducible small subunit (p53R2), of a protein called ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). Two copies of the p53R2 subunit are attached to two copies of another protein called R1 to form RNR. (R1 can also attach to another small subunit, called R2, to make another form of RNR). Whether made with p53R2 or R2, RNR helps produce DNA building blocks (nucleotides), which are joined to one another in a particular order to form DNA.RNRs containing p53R2 make nucleotides that are used for the formation of DNA in specialized cell structures called mitochondria. Although most DNA is packaged in chromosomes within the cell's nucleus (nuclear DNA), mitochondria also have a small amount of their own DNA (mitochondrial DNA or mtDNA). Mitochondria are the energy-producing centers in cells, and the DNA in these structures contains genes essential for the process of energy production (called oxidative phosphorylation). The production of nucleotides by p53R2 also helps maintain a normal amount of mtDNA in cells.

This disorder weakens the muscles that control eye movement and causes the eyelids to droop (ptosis). Some affected individuals have additional signs and symptoms, such as weakness of other muscles, extreme tiredness (fatigue), hearing loss caused by problems with the inner ear (sensorineural hearing loss), and digestive problems.Typically, mutations that cause progressive external ophthalmoplegia occur in one copy of the RRM2B gene, although rarely both copies of the gene are altered. RRM2B gene mutations associated with progressive external ophthalmoplegia lead to impaired RNR activity. These mutations result in large deletions of genetic material from mtDNA in muscle tissue, possibly because impairment of RNR activity leads to a shortage of nucleotides, although the mechanism is unclear. Researchers have not determined how deletions of mtDNA lead to the specific signs and symptoms of progressive external ophthalmoplegia, although the features of the condition may be related to impaired oxidative phosphorylation. It has been suggested that eye muscles are commonly affected by mitochondrial defects because they are especially dependent on oxidative phosphorylation for energy. More About This Health Condition      RRM2B-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with renal tubulopathy     More than a dozen mutations in the RRM2B gene can cause RRM2B-related mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, encephalomyopathic form with renal tubulopathy (RRM2B-MDS), a severe condition that affects multiple body systems. It typically leads to brain dysfunction combined with muscle weakness (encephalomyopathy) and a problem with kidney function known as renal tubulopathy. The mutations that cause this disorder occur in both copies of the RRM2B gene. They reduce the activity or amount of RNR, which likely impairs production of mtDNA nucleotides. A shortage of nucleotides available for the production of mtDNA molecules leads to a reduction in the amount of mtDNA (known as mtDNA depletion) and impairs mitochondrial function in many different types of cells.Impairment of oxidative phosphorylation is thought to underlie the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome.

            "FZD6\t   The FZD6 gene provides instructions for making a protein called frizzled-6. This protein is embedded in the outer membrane of cells, where it is involved in transmitting chemical signals from outside the cell to the cell's nucleus.Specifically, frizzled-6 participates in the Wnt signaling pathway, a series of steps that affect the way cells and tissues develop. Wnt signaling is important for cell division (proliferation), attachment of cells to one another (adhesion), cell movement (migration), and many other cellular activities. At the cell surface, frizzled-6 attaches (binds) to certain proteins, which triggers the frizzled-6 protein to send signals into the cell and initiate the Wnt signaling pathway.Frizzled-6 is active in many tissues. During early development it plays a critical role in the growth and development of nails, particularly the attachment of the nail to the nail bed. Studies suggest that frizzled-6 is also involved in hair growth.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder 10     At least three mutations in the FZD6 gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic congenital nail disorder 10. This condition is characterized by abnormally thick fingernails and toenails that may appear claw-like.

            "RP1L1\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a member of the doublecortin family. The protein encoded by this gene contains two N-terminal doublecortin domains, which bind microtubules and regulate microtubule polymerization, and two C-terminal large repetitive regions, both of which contain a high percentage of glutamine and glutamic acid residues. This protein is a retinal-specific protein. Its exact length varies among individuals due to the presence of a 16aa repeat in the first C-terminal repetitive region. The 16aa repeat is encoded by the highly polymorphic 48-bp repeat, and 1-6 copies of the 16aa repeat have been identified in normal individuals. The current reference sequence shown here has a single copy of the 16aa repeat. This protein and the RP1 protein, another retinal-specific protein, play essential and synergistic roles in affecting photosensitivity and outer segment morphogenesis of rod photoreceptors. Mutations in this gene cause occult macular dystrophy (OMD). [provided by RefSeq, Sep 2010]From UniProt:Required for the differentiation of photoreceptor cells.

            "PLEC\t   The PLEC gene provides instructions for making a protein called plectin. This protein is produced in many different tissues in the body, including skin and muscle. Within cells, plectin interacts with several molecules that make up the cell's structural framework (the cytoskeleton). For example, plectin interacts with intermediate filaments, which form networks that provide support and strength to cells. Plectin attaches (cross-links) intermediate filaments to one another and to the cell membrane.The exact function of plectin in different tissues is unclear. In skin cells, this protein is an essential part of structures called hemidesmosomes, which attach the network of intermediate filaments to the cell membrane. It is also a component of desmosomes, which form junctions between neighboring cells. As part of these structures, plectin plays a critical role in anchoring the outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) to underlying layers.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia     At least nine mutations in the PLEC gene can cause epidermolysis bullosa with pyloric atresia (EB-PA). In addition to skin blistering, people with EB-PA are born with a life-threatening obstruction of the digestive tract called pyloric atresia. Mutations in the PLEC gene account for about 15 percent of all cases of EB-PA.The PLEC gene mutations responsible for EB-PA change the normal structure and function of plectin. Mutations that prevent the cell from making any functional plectin tend to cause more severe signs and symptoms, while mutations that reduce the amount of plectin or alter the protein's structure usually cause milder signs and symptoms. A shortage of functional plectin disrupts the attachment of the epidermis to underlying skin layers, making the skin less resistant to friction and minor trauma. It is less clear how mutations in the PLEC gene are related to pyloric atresia. More About This Health Condition      Congenital myasthenic syndrome     Genetics Home Reference provides information about congenital myasthenic syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Epidermolysis bullosa simplex     At least one mutation in the PLEC gene is associated with the features of epidermolysis bullosa simplex, a condition that causes the skin to be very fragile and to blister easily. This mutation has been found in a small number of families with a form of the disorder known as the Ogna type. Researchers are uncertain whether this rare condition is actually a subtype of epidermolysis bullosa simplex or represents a separate form of epidermolysis bullosa.The mutation responsible for the Ogna type of epidermolysis bullosa simplex changes a single protein building block (amino acid) in the plectin protein. Specifically, this genetic change replaces the amino acid arginine with the amino acid tryptophan at protein position 2000 (written as Arg2000Trp or R2000W). Studies suggest that this mutation may change the way the protein folds into a 3-dimensional shape, which could prevent it from interacting with molecules that make up the cytoskeleton. In the skin, these changes cause epidermal cells to become fragile and easily damaged. As a result, the skin is less resistant to friction and minor trauma and blisters easily. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Mutations in the PLEC gene also cause at least one other form of epidermolysis bullosa known as epidermolysis bullosa with muscular dystrophy. In addition to skin blistering, people with this disorder experience progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) later in life. More than 20 PLEC gene mutations have been found to cause this form of the disorder. These mutations alter the structure, function, or production of plectin. In the skin, a reduced amount of functional plectin disrupts the attachment of the epidermis to underlying skin layers, making the skin less resistant to friction.

            "RECQL4\t   The RECQL4 gene provides instructions for making one member of a protein family called RecQ helicases. Helicases are enzymes that bind to DNA and temporarily unwind the two spiral strands (double helix) of the DNA molecule.  This unwinding is necessary for copying (replicating) DNA in preparation for cell division, and for repairing damaged DNA. Because RecQ helicases maintain the structure and integrity of DNA, they are known as the \"caretakers of the genome.\"The RECQL4 protein is active in several types of cells before and after birth. Researchers believe that this protein is particularly important in cells of the developing bones and skin. It has also been found in enterocytes, which are cells that line the intestine and absorb nutrients.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Baller-Gerold syndrome     Several mutations in the RECQL4 gene have been identified in people with Baller-Gerold syndrome. Most of these mutations prevent the production of any RECQL4 protein or change the way the protein is pieced together, which disrupts its usual function. A shortage of this protein may prevent normal DNA replication and repair, causing widespread damage to a person's genetic information over time. It is unclear how these changes result in the varied signs and symptoms of Baller-Gerold syndrome, including the abnormal fusion of certain skull bones (craniosynostosis), small stature, missing thumbs or bones in the forearm (radial ray malformations), and a skin rash. More About This Health Condition      RAPADILINO syndrome     At least 10 mutations in the RECQL4 gene have been identified in people with RAPADILINO syndrome. This condition has many features, including radial ray malformations, malformed or missing kneecaps, diarrhea, and short stature. The condition was first identified in Finland, and the most common mutation in RAPADILINO syndrome is found in all affected individuals of Finnish descent as well as some people from other populations. This mutation, which is written as IVS7+2delT, is known as a splice-site mutation, and it causes the RECQL4 protein to be pieced together incorrectly. This genetic change results in the production of a protein that is missing a region called exon 7. The altered protein does not have helicase activity, which may prevent normal DNA replication and repair. These changes may result in the accumulation of DNA errors and cell death, although it is unclear exactly how RECQL4 gene mutations lead to the specific features of RAPADILINO syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Rothmund-Thomson syndrome     More than 40 mutations in the RECQL4 gene have been found in people with Rothmund-Thomson syndrome. These mutations likely prevent the production of any RECQL4 protein or lead to the production of an abnormally short, nonfunctional version of the protein. A shortage of this protein may prevent normal DNA replication and repair, causing widespread damage to a person's genetic information over time. Further study is needed to determine how these changes result in the characteristic features of Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, which include a skin rash, sparse hair, small stature, skeletal abnormalities, and an increased risk of certain cancers.Because Rothmund-Thomson syndrome, Baller-Gerold syndrome, and RAPADILINO syndrome have overlapping features and can be caused by mutations in the same gene, researchers are investigating whether they are separate disorders or part of a single syndrome with overlapping signs and symptoms.

            "LPL\t   The LPL gene provides instructions for making an enzyme called lipoprotein lipase. This enzyme is found primarily on the surface of cells that line tiny blood vessels (capillaries) within muscles and in fatty (adipose) tissue. Lipoprotein lipase plays a critical role in breaking down fat in the form of triglycerides, which are carried from various organs to the blood by molecules called lipoproteins.Lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides carried by two different types of lipoproteins, which bring fat to the bloodstream from different organs. Fat from the intestine, which is taken in from the diet, is transported to the bloodstream by lipoproteins called chylomicrons. Another type of lipoprotein called very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) carries triglycerides from the liver to the bloodstream. When lipoprotein lipase breaks down triglycerides, the fat molecules are used by the body as energy or stored in fatty tissue for later use.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency     More than 220 mutations in the LPL gene have been found to cause familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. This condition disrupts the normal breakdown of triglycerides in the body, resulting in an increase of these fats. The most common mutation in people of European ancestry replaces the protein building block (amino acid) glycine with the amino acid glutamic acid at position 188 in the enzyme (written as Gly188Glu or G188E). Mutations that cause familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency reduce or eliminate lipoprotein lipase activity, which prevents the enzyme from effectively breaking down triglycerides in the bloodstream. As a result, triglycerides attached to lipoproteins accumulate in the blood and tissues, leading to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis), enlarged liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), fatty deposits in the skin (eruptive xanthomas), and the other signs and symptoms of familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Certain variations in the LPL gene have been shown to influence the levels of fats in the bloodstream. The LPL gene variants likely result in the production of lipoprotein lipase enzymes with altered abilities to break down triglycerides. In some cases, the enzyme is overactive, resulting in low fat levels. In other cases, the enzyme is impaired, resulting in increased fat levels, a condition called hyperlipidemia. Individuals with hyperlipidemia are at greater than normal risk of developing atherosclerosis, a condition in which fatty deposits accumulate on artery walls. This fatty material hardens over time, eventually blocking the arteries and increasing the chance of having a heart attack or stroke. It is unclear how much of a role LPL gene variants play in the development of atherosclerosis, as a large number of genetic and environmental factors determine the risk of developing this complex condition.        Related Information   What is a gene mutation and how do mutations occur?What kinds of gene mutations are possible?More about Mutations and Health      More than 220 mutations in the LPL gene have been found to cause familial lipoprotein lipase deficiency. This condition disrupts the normal breakdown of triglycerides in the body, resulting in an increase of these fats.

            "SFTPC\t   The SFTPC gene provides instructions for making a protein called surfactant protein-C (SP-C). This protein is one of four proteins (each produced from a different gene) in surfactant, a mixture of certain fats (called phospholipids) and proteins that lines the lung tissue and makes breathing easy. Without normal surfactant, the tissue surrounding the air sacs in the lungs (the alveoli) sticks together after exhalation (because of a force called surface tension), causing the alveoli to collapse. As a result, filling the lungs with air on each breath becomes very difficult, and the delivery of oxygen to the body is impaired. Surfactant lowers surface tension, easing breathing and avoiding lung collapse. The SP-C protein helps spread the surfactant across the surface of the lung tissue, aiding in the surface tension-lowering property of surfactant.The phospholipids and proteins that make up surfactant are packaged in cellular structures known as lamellar bodies, which are found in specialized lung cells. The surfactant proteins must go through several processing steps to mature and become functional; some of these steps occur in lamellar bodies.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Surfactant dysfunction     More than 35 mutations in the SFTPC gene have been identified in people with surfactant dysfunction. When this condition is caused by mutations in the SFTPC gene (sometimes called SP-C dysfunction), it can cause severe breathing problems in newborns or gradual onset of milder breathing problems in children or adults.SFTPC gene mutations associated with surfactant dysfunction affect the processing of the SP-C protein. Many of the mutations occur in a particular region of the gene called the BRICHOS domain, which appears to be involved in the processing and cellular placement of the SP-C protein.Mutations in the SFTPC gene result in a reduction or absence of mature SP-C and a buildup of abnormal forms of SP-C. It is unclear which of these outcomes causes the signs and symptoms of SP-C dysfunction. Lack of mature SP-C can lead to abnormal composition of surfactant and decreased surfactant function. The loss of functional surfactant would raise surface tension in the alveoli, causing difficulty breathing and collapse of the lungs. Alternatively, research suggests that abnormally processed SP-C proteins form the wrong three-dimensional shape and accumulate inside lung cells. These misfolded proteins may trigger a cellular response that results in cell damage and death. This damage may disrupt surfactant production and release, leading to the breathing problems associated with surfactant dysfunction.

This protein is found in cell structures called mitochondria, which convert the energy from food into a form that cells can use. Transmembrane protein 70 is thought to play an important role in assembling and stabilizing a group of proteins called complex V. Complex V is the last of five complexes that carry out a multistep process called oxidative phosphorylation, through which cells derive much of their energy. Complex V is involved in the final step of oxidative phosphorylation. Specifically, one segment of complex V allows positively charged particles, called protons, to flow across a specialized membrane inside mitochondria. Another segment of complex V uses the energy created by this proton flow to convert a molecule called adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is used by the cell as energy.Transmembrane protein 70 is also thought to be involved in the assembly of complex I, which is the first mitochondrial complex involved in oxidative phosphorylation.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Mitochondrial complex V deficiency     At least 12 mutations in the TMEM70 gene have been identified in people who have mitochondrial complex V deficiency, a disorder with a wide variety of signs and symptoms. A few of these gene mutations are particular to people of Roma or Arab descent, and account for the majority of mitochondrial complex V deficiency cases caused by TMEM70 gene mutations. This disorder can also be caused by mutations in other genes.The signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex V deficiency are most prominent in organs and tissues that require a large amount of energy, such as the brain and heart. Abnormal brain function (encephalopathy) and other neurological problems can occur. Another common feature of mitochondrial complex V deficiency, especially when caused by TMEM70 gene mutations, is hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. This condition is characterized by thickening (hypertrophy) of the heart (cardiac) muscle that can lead to heart failure. TMEM70 gene mutations alter transmembrane protein 70 and impair its ability to perform its function in complex V assembly. As a result, the amount of complex V in cells is reduced. The resulting impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and energy production leads to the signs and symptoms of mitochondrial complex V deficiency.

Members of this family contain a conserved 100-amino acid DNA-binding 'forkhead' domain. The encoded protein functions as a thyroid transcription factor that plays a role in thyroid morphogenesis. Mutations in this gene are associated with the Bamforth-Lazarus syndrome, and with susceptibility to nonmedullary thyroid cancer-4. [provided by RefSeq, Nov 2016]From UniProt:Transcription factor that binds consensus sites on a variety of gene promoters and activate their transcription. Involved in proper palate formation, most probably through the expression of MSX1 and TGFB3 genes which are direct targets of this transcription factor. Also implicated in thyroid gland morphogenesis. May indirectly play a role in cell growth and migration through the regulation of WNT5A expression.

            "ALDOB\t   The ALDOB gene provides instructions for making the aldolase B enzyme. This enzyme is one of a group of three aldolase enzymes that are responsible for breaking down certain molecules in cells throughout the body. Four identical aldolase B enzymes need to be attached (bound) to each other in a four-enzyme unit called a tetramer to work.Aldolase B is found primarily in the liver, but it is also present at lower levels in kidney and intestinal cells. Aldolase B is involved in the breakdown (metabolism) of the simple sugar fructose, which is found mostly in fruits and is used in the body for energy. Aldolase B is responsible for the second step in the metabolism of fructose, which breaks down the molecule fructose-1-phosphate into glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone phosphate. To a lesser degree, aldolase B is also involved in the breakdown of the simple sugar glucose.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Hereditary fructose intolerance     More than 50 mutations in the ALDOB gene have been found to cause hereditary fructose intolerance, a condition characterized by nausea and intestinal discomfort following ingestion of foods containing fructose. Most of these mutations replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the aldolase B enzyme and result in the production of an enzyme with reduced function. A mutation found in approximately half of people with hereditary fructose intolerance replaces the amino acid alanine with the amino acid proline at position 149 in the enzyme (written as Ala149Pro or A149P). This mutation alters the 3-dimensional shape of the enzyme. Alteration of the shape of the enzyme makes it difficult for the aldolase B enzymes to bind together and form tetramers. If it is not in a tetramer, aldolase B cannot metabolize fructose.A lack of functional aldolase B results in an accumulation of fructose-1-phosphate in liver cells. This buildup is toxic, resulting in the death of liver cells over time. Additionally, the breakdown products of fructose-1-phosphase are needed in the body to produce energy and to maintain blood sugar levels. The combination of decreased cellular energy, low blood sugar, and liver cell death leads to the features of hereditary fructose intolerance.

            "FKTN\t   The FKTN gene (formerly known as FCMD) provides instructions for making a protein called fukutin. This protein is present in many of the body's tissues but is particularly abundant in heart (cardiac) muscle, the brain, and the muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles). Within cells, fukutin is found in a specialized structure called the Golgi apparatus, where newly produced proteins are modified.The fukutin protein is involved in a protein modification process called glycosylation. Through this chemical process, sugar molecules are added to certain proteins. In particular, the fukutin protein adds a molecule called ribitol 5-phosphate to the chain of sugars attached to a protein called alpha (α)-dystroglycan. Glycosylation is critical for the normal function of α-dystroglycan.The α-dystroglycan protein helps anchor the structural framework inside each cell (cytoskeleton) to the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). In skeletal muscles, glycosylated α-dystroglycan helps stabilize and protect muscle fibers. In the brain, it helps direct the movement (migration) of nerve cells (neurons) during early development.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy     At least 18 mutations in the FKTN gene have been found to cause Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy, a condition that causes skeletal muscle weakness and brain and eye abnormalities. This form of congenital muscular dystrophy is seen almost exclusively in Japan. Virtually everyone with this condition has at least one copy of the same mutation, an insertion of about 3,000 extra DNA building blocks (3 kilobases [kb]) in the FKTN gene. This insertion occurs in a part of the gene known as the 3' untranslated region, which helps regulate the gene's activity. Researchers believe that the 3-kb insertion reduces the amount of fukutin protein that is produced from the gene.A shortage of fukutin prevents the normal glycosylation of α-dystroglycan. As a result, α-dystroglycan can no longer effectively anchor cells to the proteins and other molecules that surround them. Without functional α-dystroglycan to stabilize the muscle fibers, they become damaged as they repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged fibers weaken and die over time, which affects the development, structure, and function of skeletal muscles in people with Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy.Defective α-dystroglycan also affects the migration of neurons during the early development of the brain. Instead of stopping when they reach their intended destinations, some neurons migrate past the surface of the brain into the fluid-filled space that surrounds it. Researchers believe that this problem with neuronal migration causes a brain abnormality called cobblestone lissencephaly, in which the surface of the brain lacks the normal folds and grooves and instead appears bumpy and irregular. Less is known about the effects of FKTN mutations in other parts of the body. More About This Health Condition      Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy     Genetics Home Reference provides information about limb-girdle muscular dystrophy. More About This Health Condition      Walker-Warburg syndrome     At least 11 FKTN gene mutations have been identified in people with Walker-Warburg syndrome, the most severe form of congenital muscular dystrophy. This condition is found in populations worldwide. Like Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (described above), Walker-Warburg syndrome is associated with skeletal muscle weakness and eye and brain abnormalities, including cobblestone lissencephaly; however, individuals with Walker-Warburg syndrome have more severe brain and eye abnormalities and live only into infancy or early childhood. The FKTN gene mutations associated with this condition prevent the production of any functional fukutin protein, which leads to the severe muscle, eye, and brain problems that develop in Walker-Warburg syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Mutations in the FKTN gene cause other disorders that affect skeletal muscles and the heart. Unlike Fukuyama congenital muscular dystrophy (described above), which is mostly limited to the Japanese population, these conditions have been described in several populations worldwide.Several people with a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy have been found to have mutations in the FKTN gene. This condition weakens and enlarges the heart, preventing it from pumping blood efficiently. When dilated cardiomyopathy is associated with FKTN gene mutations, it is known as type 1X (DCM1X). In addition to heart problems, some people with DCM1X have experienced mild skeletal muscle weakness beginning in adulthood.Changes in the FKTN gene that reduce but do not eliminate the production of fukutin lead to the somewhat less severe medical problems seen in DCM1X and limb-girdle muscular dystrophy (linked above).

            "COL5A1\t   The COL5A1 gene provides instructions for making a component of type V collagen. Collagens are a family of proteins that strengthen and support many tissues in the body, including skin, ligaments, bones, tendons, and muscles.A component of type V collagen called the pro-α1(V) chain is produced from the COL5A1 gene. Collagens begin as rope-like procollagen molecules that are each made up of three chains. Two combinations of chains can produce type V collagen: three pro-α1(V) chains or two pro-α1(V) chains and one pro-α2(V) chain (which is produced from the COL5A2 gene).The triple-stranded procollagen molecules are processed by enzymes outside the cell to create mature collagen. The collagen molecules then arrange themselves into long, thin fibrils with another form of collagen, type I. Type V collagen regulates the width (diameter) of those fibrils. Studies suggest that type V collagen also controls the assembly of other types of collagen into fibrils in several tissues.

Ehlers-Danlos syndrome is a group of disorders that affect the connective tissues that support the skin, bones, blood vessels, and many other organs and tissues. This form of the disorder is characterized by skin that is soft, highly stretchy (elastic), and fragile; abnormal scarring; and an unusually large range of joint movement (hypermobility). More than 100 COL5A1 gene mutations have been identified in people with classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. The mutations affect one copy of the gene in each cell, reducing the amount of pro-α1(V) chains that cells produce. As a result, fibrils containing type V and type I collagens in the skin and other tissues are disorganized and larger than usual. Researchers believe that the abnormal collagen weakens connective tissues throughout the body, which causes the signs and symptoms of classical Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.

            "AGPAT2\t   The AGPAT2 gene provides instructions for making an enzyme that is found in many of the body's cells and tissues. It plays a critical role in the growth and development of adipocytes, which are cells that store fats for energy. Adipocytes are the major component of the body's fatty (adipose) tissue.The AGPAT2 enzyme is part of a chemical pathway in many cells that produces two important types of fats (lipids): glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.  Glycerophospholipids are the major component of cell membranes and are involved in chemical signaling within cells. Triacylglycerols (also known as triglycerides) are fat molecules that are stored in adipocytes for later conversion to energy.The AGPAT2 enzyme is responsible for a particular chemical reaction in the production of these two types of lipids.  Specifically, the enzyme helps convert a molecule called lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) to another molecule, phosphatidic acid (PA).  Additional reactions convert phosphatidic acid to glycerophospholipids and triacylglycerols.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Congenital generalized lipodystrophy     At least 26 mutations in the AGPAT2 gene have been identified in people with congenital generalized lipodystrophy (also called Berardinelli-Seip congenital lipodystrophy) type 1. This rare condition is characterized by an almost total absence of adipose tissue and a very muscular appearance. A shortage of adipose tissue leads to multiple health problems, including high levels of triglycerides circulating in the bloodstream (hypertriglyceridemia) and diabetes mellitus.The AGPAT2 gene mutations that cause congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1 greatly reduce or eliminate the activity of the AGPAT2 enzyme. Studies suggest that a loss of this enzyme's activity reduces the production and storage of triacylglycerols in adipocytes, which prevents these cells from storing fats. A lack of enzyme activity may also reduce the levels of glycerophospholipids in adipocytes, which changes the structure of the cell membrane and disrupts normal signaling within these cells. All of these abnormalities prevent the body from storing fats normally in adipose tissue. The resulting lack of body fat underlies the varied signs and symptoms of congenital generalized lipodystrophy type 1.

            "CACNA1B\t   From NCBI Gene:The protein encoded by this gene is the pore-forming subunit of an N-type voltage-dependent calcium channel, which controls neurotransmitter release from neurons. The encoded protein forms a complex with alpha-2, beta, and delta subunits to form the high-voltage activated channel. This channel is sensitive to omega-conotoxin-GVIA and omega-agatoxin-IIIA but insensitive to dihydropyridines. Two transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been found for this gene. [provided by RefSeq, Aug 2011]From UniProt:Voltage-sensitive calcium channels (VSCC) mediate the entry of calcium ions into excitable cells and are also involved in a variety of calcium-dependent processes, including muscle contraction, hormone or neurotransmitter release, gene expression, cell motility, cell division and cell death. The isoform alpha-1B gives rise to N-type calcium currents. N-type calcium channels belong to the 'high-voltage activated' (HVA) group and are specifically blocked by omega-conotoxin-GVIA (AC P01522) (AC P01522) (By similarity). They are however insensitive to dihydropyridines (DHP). Calcium channels containing alpha-1B subunit may play a role in directed migration of immature neurons.

            "SMARCA2\t   The SMARCA2 gene provides instructions for making one piece (subunit) of a group of similar protein complexes known as SWI/SNF complexes. These complexes regulate gene activity (expression) by a process known as chromatin remodeling. Chromatin is the network of DNA and proteins that packages DNA into chromosomes. The structure of chromatin can be changed (remodeled) to alter how tightly DNA is packaged. Chromatin remodeling is one way gene expression is regulated during development; when DNA is tightly packed, gene expression is lower than when DNA is loosely packed. SWI/SNF complexes help with chromatin remodeling by moving parts of chromatin called nucleosomes, which makes DNA more accessible for gene expression. To provide energy for chromatin remodeling, the SMARCA2 protein uses a molecule called ATP.SWI/SNF complexes regulate genes that are involved in many processes, including repairing damaged DNA; copying (replicating) DNA; and controlling the growth, division, and maturation (differentiation) of cells. The SMARCA2 protein and other SWI/SNF subunits are thought to act as tumor suppressors, which keep cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome     At least 50 mutations in the SMARCA2 gene have been found to cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. This condition is characterized by multiple abnormalities, primarily sparse scalp hair, small head size (microcephaly), distinctive facial features, short stature, abnormal fingers, recurrent seizures (epilepsy), and moderate to severe intellectual disability with impaired language development. Almost all SMARCA2 gene mutations that cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome change single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the protein. These mutations are located within an area of the protein that attaches to ATP and is responsible for providing energy to the SWI/SNF complexes. These altered proteins are able to form SWI/SNF complexes, but these complexes are nonfunctional and cannot participate in chromatin remodeling. Disturbance of this regulatory process alters the activity of many genes, which likely explains the diverse signs and symptoms of Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     Common DNA variants (polymorphisms) that affect the SMARCA2 gene have been found in certain types of cancer, particularly lung cancer in tobacco smokers and head and neck cancer. The changes that are associated with these cancers are described as germline, meaning that they are present from birth and found in all of the body's cells. (While the mutations that cause Nicolaides-Baraitser syndrome, which is described above, are also germline, there is no increased risk for cancer in individuals with that condition.) Two specific SMARCA2 gene polymorphisms have been found to be associated with the development of these cancers. These changes occur in an area near the SMARCA2 gene called the promoter region, which controls the production of the SMARCA2 protein. One change adds seven building blocks of DNA (nucleotides) at position -741 (insTATTTTT); the other adds six nucleotides at position -1321 (insTTTTAA) of the promoter. The incidence of lung cancer and head and neck cancer is increased only when both of these polymorphisms are present in both copies of the SMARCA2 gene in each cell.These polymorphisms impair the function of the promoter and reduce the expression of the SMARCA2 gene. The reduced gene activity likely decreases or alters protein production, which would lead to changes in SWI/SNF complexes. These changes may impair normal cell differentiation, which leads to the overgrowth of certain cell types, causing cancer. Alternatively, abnormal SWI/SNF complexes may disrupt the regulation of genes that help control the growth and division of cells, which leads to cancer. It is unclear why these changes in the promoter region of the SMARCA2 gene seem to be associated only with head and neck cancer and lung cancer in smokers.

            "DOCK8\t   The DOCK8 gene provides instructions for making a member of the DOCK family of proteins. The proteins in this family act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs). GEFs turn on (activate) proteins called GTPases, which play an important role in chemical signaling within cells. Signaling stimulated by DOCK family proteins are typically involved in the arrangement of the structural framework inside cells (the cytoskeleton). By controlling the shape of the cytoskeleton, DOCK family proteins play a role in cell structure and movement (migration).The DOCK8 protein is found most abundantly in cells of the immune system. DOCK8 plays a critical role in the survival and function of several types of immune system cells, including T cells, NK cells, and B cells. T cells and NK cells recognize and attack foreign invaders, such as viruses, to prevent infection. B cells produce proteins called antibodies, which attach to foreign particles and germs and mark them for destruction.Through its function as a GEF, the DOCK8 protein helps maintain the structure and integrity of T cells and NK cells. It also aids in the migration of these immune system cells to sites of infection, particularly the skin. DOCK8 is also involved in chemical signaling pathways that stimulate B cells to mature and produce antibodies. DOCK8 is also involved in the normal development and survival of other types of immune system cells.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome     At least 110 mutations in the DOCK8 gene have been found to cause autosomal recessive hyper-IgE syndrome (AR-HIES), an immune system disorder that causes recurrent severe infections of the skin and respiratory tract. Most of the mutations involved in this disorder delete regions of DNA from the DOCK8 gene. These deletions and other DOCK8 gene mutations lead to an abnormally short protein, if any protein is produced. As a result, affected individuals have little or no functional DOCK8 protein.A shortage of DOCK8 protein impairs normal immune cell development and function. It is thought that T cells lacking DOCK8 cannot maintain their shape as they move through dense spaces, such as those found within the skin. The abnormal cells die, resulting in reduced numbers of these cells. A shortage of T cells impairs the immune response to foreign invaders, accounting for the severe skin infections common in AR-HIES. A lack of DOCK8 also impairs B cell maturation and the production of antibodies. Impairment of this type of immune response leads to recurrent respiratory tract infections in people with this disorder. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     Mutations affecting the DOCK8 gene have been found in two individuals with a rare form of intellectual disability described in the medical literature as autosomal dominant mental retardation 2. These individuals have developmental delays, including delayed or absent speech. The mutations involved in this condition result in production of an abnormally short DOCK8 protein. Unlike in AR-HIES (described above), the mutations associated with autosomal dominant mental retardation 2 affect only one copy of the DOCK8 gene. Researchers are unsure how these genetic changes lead to intellectual disability.

            "DDX58\t   From NCBI Gene:DEAD box proteins, characterized by the conserved motif Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp (DEAD), are putative RNA helicases which are implicated in a number of cellular processes involving RNA binding and alteration of RNA secondary structure. This gene encodes a protein containing RNA helicase-DEAD box protein motifs and a caspase recruitment domain (CARD). It is involved in viral double-stranded (ds) RNA recognition and the regulation of immune response. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Innate immune receptor which acts as a cytoplasmic sensor of viral nucleic acids and plays a major role in sensing viral infection and in the activation of a cascade of antiviral responses including the induction of type I interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Its ligands include: 5'-triphosphorylated ssRNA and dsRNA and short dsRNA (<1 kb in length). In addition to the 5'-triphosphate moiety, blunt-end base pairing at the 5'-end of the RNA is very essential. Overhangs at the non-triphosphorylated end of the dsRNA RNA have no major impact on its activity. A 3'overhang at the 5'triphosphate end decreases and any 5'overhang at the 5' triphosphate end abolishes its activity. Upon ligand binding it associates with mitochondria antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/IPS1) which activates the IKK-related kinases: TBK1 and IKBKE which phosphorylate interferon regulatory factors: IRF3 and IRF7 which in turn activate transcription of antiviral immunological genes, including interferons (IFNs); IFN-alpha and IFN-beta. Detects both positive and negative strand RNA viruses including members of the families Paramyxoviridae: Human respiratory syncytial virus and measles virus (MeV), Rhabdoviridae: vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), Orthomyxoviridae: influenza A and B virus, Flaviviridae: Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), dengue virus (DENV) and west Nile virus (WNV). It also detects rotavirus and reovirus. Also involved in antiviral signaling in response to viruses containing a dsDNA genome such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Detects dsRNA produced from non-self dsDNA by RNA polymerase III, such as Epstein-Barr virus-encoded RNAs (EBERs).

            "AQP7\t   From NCBI Gene:This gene encodes a member of the aquaporin family of water-selective membrane channels. The encoded protein localizes to the plasma membrane and allows movement of water, glycerol and urea across cell membranes. This gene is highly expressed in the adipose tissue where the encoded protein facilitates efflux of glycerol. In the proximal straight tubules of kidney, the encoded protein is localized to the apical membrane and prevents excretion of glycerol into urine. The encoded protein is present in spermatids, as well as in the testicular and epididymal spermatozoa suggesting an important role in late spermatogenesis. Alternative splicing of this gene results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. This gene is located adjacent to a related aquaporin gene on chromosome 9. Multiple pseudogenes of this gene have been identified. [provided by RefSeq, Dec 2015]From UniProt:Forms a channel that mediates water and glycerol transport across cell membranes at neutral pH (PubMed:9405233, PubMed:11952783, PubMed:30423801, PubMed:30420639). The channel is also permeable to urea (PubMed:9405233). Plays an important role in body energy homeostasis under conditions that promote lipid catabolism, giving rise to glycerol and free fatty acids. Mediates glycerol export from adipocytes. After release into the blood stream, glycerol is used for gluconeogenesis in the liver to maintain normal blood glucose levels and prevent fasting hypoglycemia.

            "TPM2\t   The TPM2 gene provides instructions for making a protein called beta (β)-tropomyosin, which is part of the tropomyosin protein family. Tropomyosin proteins regulate the tensing of muscle fibers (muscle contraction) by controlling the binding of two muscle proteins, myosin and actin. In non-muscle cells, tropomyosin proteins play a role in controlling cell shape.β-tropomyosin is found primarily in skeletal muscles, which are the muscles used for movement. This protein helps regulate muscle contraction by interacting with other muscle proteins, particularly myosin and actin. These interactions are essential for stabilizing and maintaining structures called sarcomeres within muscle cells. Sarcomeres are the basic units of muscle contraction; they are made of proteins that generate the mechanical force needed for muscles to contract.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Cap myopathy     At least three TPM2 gene mutations have been identified in people with cap myopathy, a disorder that leads to muscle weakness (myopathy) and poor muscle tone (hypotonia). These mutations delete or duplicate genetic material in the TPM2 gene or replace single protein building blocks (amino acids) in the β-tropomyosin protein sequence. The specific effects of these TPM2 gene mutations are unclear, but researchers suggest they may interfere with normal actin-myosin binding, impairing muscle contraction and resulting in the muscle weakness that occurs in cap myopathy. More About This Health Condition      Distal arthrogryposis type 1     At least three mutations in the TPM2 gene have been found to cause distal arthrogryposis type 1, a disorder characterized by joint deformities (contractures) in the hands and feet. It is unclear how these mutations lead to contractures in people with distal arthrogryposis type 1, or why the joint problems are typically limited to the hands and feet. However, researchers speculate that contractures may be related to problems with muscle contraction that limit the movement of joints before birth.

            "EXOSC3\t   The EXOSC3 gene provides instructions for making a protein known as exosome component 3. As its name suggests, this protein forms one part (subunit) of a large, multi-protein complex known as the RNA exosome. Within cells, this complex helps to process multiple types of RNA, which are chemical cousins of DNA, by cutting (cleaving) RNA molecules in certain places. The RNA exosome also breaks down (degrades) molecules of RNA when they are no longer needed. Appropriate processing and breakdown of RNA molecules is essential for the normal functioning of all cells.Studies suggest that the activity of exosome component 3 is necessary for the normal development and growth of certain areas of the brain, particularly the cerebellum, which is the part of the brain that coordinates movement. Exosome component 3 also appears to be important for the survival of specialized nerve cells in the spinal cord called motor neurons, which play an essential role in muscle movement.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Pontocerebellar hypoplasia     At least 16 mutations in the EXOSC3 gene have been identified in people with a disorder of brain development called pontocerebellar hypoplasia. The major features of this condition include delayed development overall, an unusually small head size (microcephaly), and intellectual disability. EXOSC3 gene mutations cause about half of all cases of a form of the disorder designated pontocerebellar hypoplasia type 1 (PCH1). When PCH1 results from EXOSC3 gene mutations, it is sometimes categorized more specifically as PCH1B. In addition to the features listed above, PCH1B causes problems with muscle movement resulting from a loss of specialized nerve cells called motor neurons in the spinal cord.The EXOSC3 gene mutations that cause PCH1B result in an exosome component 3 protein with reduced or no function. The most common mutation alters a single protein building block (amino acid) in exosome component 3; it replaces the amino acid aspartic acid with the amino acid alanine at protein position 132 (written as Asp132Ala or D132A). People with this mutation tend to have somewhat less severe brain abnormalities than people with other EXOSC3 gene mutations. Changes in this gene likely impair the activity of the RNA exosome, but it is unclear how these alterations lead to the problems with brain development and loss of motor neurons characteristic of PCH1B.

            "PTCH1\t   The PTCH1 gene provides instructions for producing the patched-1 protein, which functions as a receptor. Receptor proteins have specific sites into which certain other proteins, called ligands, fit like keys into locks. A protein called Sonic Hedgehog is the ligand for the patched-1 receptor. Together, ligands and their receptors trigger signals that affect cell development and function.Patched-1 and Sonic Hedgehog function in a pathway that is essential for early development. This pathway plays a role in cell growth, cell specialization, and determining the shape (patterning) of many different parts of the developing body. When Sonic Hedgehog is not present, patched-1 prevents cells from growing and dividing (proliferating). When Sonic Hedgehog is attached, patched-1 stops suppressing cell proliferation.  Based on its role in preventing cells from proliferating in an uncontrolled way, PTCH1 is called a tumor suppressor gene.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Gorlin syndrome     More than 225 mutations in the PTCH1 gene have been found to cause Gorlin syndrome (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), a condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. Mutations in this gene prevent the production of patched-1 or lead to the production of an abnormal version of the receptor. An altered or missing patched-1 receptor cannot effectively suppress cell growth and division. As a result, cells proliferate uncontrollably to form the tumors that are characteristic of Gorlin syndrome. It is less clear how PTCH1 gene mutations cause the other signs and symptoms related to this condition, including small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, an unusually large head size (macrocephaly), and skeletal abnormalities. More About This Health Condition      Nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly     Genetics Home Reference provides information about nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. More About This Health Condition      9q22.3 microdeletion     The PTCH1 gene is located in a region of chromosome 9 that is deleted in people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion. As a result of this deletion, affected individuals are missing one copy of the PTCH1 gene in each cell. Researchers believe that many of the features associated with 9q22.3 microdeletions, particularly the signs and symptoms of Gorlin syndrome (described above), result from a loss of the PTCH1 gene. When this gene is missing, patched-1 is not available to suppress cell proliferation. As a result, cells divide uncontrollably to form the tumors that are characteristic of Gorlin syndrome. Other signs and symptoms related to 9q22.3 microdeletions (such as delayed development, intellectual disability, overgrowth of the body, and other physical abnormalities) may result from the loss of additional genes in the deleted region of chromosome 9. More About This Health Condition      Coloboma     Genetics Home Reference provides information about coloboma. More About This Health Condition      Cancers     Some mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These genetic changes, called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in both copies of the PTCH1 gene are associated with a non-hereditary (sporadic) type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma. Other sporadic types of cancer may be associated with somatic mutations in the PTCH1 gene, including some forms of skin cancer, a childhood brain tumor called medulloblastoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer. A noncancerous (benign) jaw tumor called a keratocystic odontogenic tumor can also be associated with somatic PTCH1 gene mutations.      Other disorders     At least seven mutations in the PTCH1 gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. This condition occurs when the brain fails to divide into two halves during early development. PTCH1 gene mutations are a rare cause of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. These mutations prevent the signaling that is necessary for normal brain cell patterning. The signs and symptoms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are caused by abnormal development of the brain and face.        Related Information   What is a gene mutation and how do mutations occur?What kinds of gene mutations are possible?More about Mutations and Health      More than 225 mutations in the PTCH1 gene have been found to cause Gorlin syndrome (also known as nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome), a condition that affects many areas of the body and increases the risk of developing various cancerous and noncancerous tumors. Mutations in this gene prevent the production of patched-1 or lead to the production of an abnormal version of the receptor. An altered or missing patched-1 receptor cannot effectively suppress cell growth and division. As a result, cells proliferate uncontrollably to form the tumors that are characteristic of Gorlin syndrome. It is less clear how PTCH1 gene mutations cause the other signs and symptoms related to this condition, including small depressions (pits) in the skin of the palms of the hands and soles of the feet, an unusually large head size (macrocephaly), and skeletal abnormalities. More About This Health Condition  Genetics Home Reference provides information about nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. More About This Health Condition  The PTCH1 gene is located in a region of chromosome 9 that is deleted in people with a 9q22.3 microdeletion. As a result of this deletion, affected individuals are missing one copy of the PTCH1 gene in each cell. Researchers believe that many of the features associated with 9q22.3 microdeletions, particularly the signs and symptoms of Gorlin syndrome (described above), result from a loss of the PTCH1 gene. When this gene is missing, patched-1 is not available to suppress cell proliferation. As a result, cells divide uncontrollably to form the tumors that are characteristic of Gorlin syndrome. Other signs and symptoms related to 9q22.3 microdeletions (such as delayed development, intellectual disability, overgrowth of the body, and other physical abnormalities) may result from the loss of additional genes in the deleted region of chromosome 9. More About This Health Condition  Genetics Home Reference provides information about coloboma. More About This Health Condition  Some mutations are acquired during a person's lifetime and are present only in certain cells. These genetic changes, called somatic mutations, are not inherited. Somatic mutations in both copies of the PTCH1 gene are associated with a non-hereditary (sporadic) type of skin cancer called basal cell carcinoma. Other sporadic types of cancer may be associated with somatic mutations in the PTCH1 gene, including some forms of skin cancer, a childhood brain tumor called medulloblastoma, breast cancer, and colon cancer. A noncancerous (benign) jaw tumor called a keratocystic odontogenic tumor can also be associated with somatic PTCH1 gene mutations.  At least seven mutations in the PTCH1 gene have been found to cause nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. This condition occurs when the brain fails to divide into two halves during early development. PTCH1 gene mutations are a rare cause of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly. These mutations prevent the signaling that is necessary for normal brain cell patterning. The signs and symptoms of nonsyndromic holoprosencephaly are caused by abnormal development of the brain and face.

            "GRIA3\t   From NCBI Gene:Glutamate receptors are the predominant excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the mammalian brain and are activated in a variety of normal neurophysiologic processes. These receptors are heteromeric protein complexes composed of multiple subunits, arranged to form ligand-gated ion channels. The classification of glutamate receptors is based on their activation by different pharmacologic agonists. The subunit encoded by this gene belongs to a family of AMPA (alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionate)-sensitive glutamate receptors, and is subject to RNA editing (AGA->GGA; R->G). Alternative splicing at this locus results in different isoforms, which may vary in their signal transduction properties. [provided by RefSeq, Jul 2008]From UniProt:Receptor for glutamate that functions as ligand-gated ion channel in the central nervous system and plays an important role in excitatory synaptic transmission. L-glutamate acts as an excitatory neurotransmitter at many synapses in the central nervous system. Binding of the excitatory neurotransmitter L-glutamate induces a conformation change, leading to the opening of the cation channel, and thereby converts the chemical signal to an electrical impulse. The receptor then desensitizes rapidly and enters a transient inactive state, characterized by the presence of bound agonist. In the presence of CACNG4 or CACNG7 or CACNG8, shows resensitization which is characterized by a delayed accumulation of current flux upon continued application of glutamate.

            "GPR101\t   The GPR101 gene provides instructions for making a type of protein called a G protein-coupled receptor. G protein-coupled receptors are embedded in the outer membrane of cells, where they relay chemical signals from outside the cell to the interior of the cell. However, the specific function of the GPR101 protein is unknown. The protein is found primarily in the brain, and studies suggest that it has a role in the pituitary gland. This gland, located at the base of the brain, produces hormones that control many important body functions. One of these hormones, called growth hormone, helps direct normal growth of the body's bones and tissues. The GPR101 protein is predominantly expressed in the pituitary gland during development before birth and again at adolescence, stages when the body grows the most. The protein is thought to be involved in the growth of cells in the pituitary gland, in the release of growth hormone from the gland, or in both processes.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           X-linked acrogigantism     Genetic changes involving the GPR101 gene cause a condition called X-linked acrogigantism (X-LAG), which is characterized by abnormally fast growth beginning in infancy or early childhood. Signs and symptoms of the condition result from enlargement (hyperplasia) of the gland or development of a noncancerous tumor in the gland (called a pituitary adenoma). The abnormal gland releases more growth hormone than normal, causing rapid growth in individuals with X-LAG.X-LAG occurs when a small amount of genetic material on the X chromosome is abnormally copied (duplicated). The duplication, often referred to as an Xq26.3 microduplication, occurs on the long (q) arm of the chromosome at a location designated q26.3. Although several genes can be duplicated, only an extra copy of the GPR101 gene is necessary to cause X-LAG. Duplication of the gene leads to an excess of GPR101 protein. It is unclear how extra GPR101 protein results in pituitary adenoma or hyperplasia or the release of excess growth hormone. More About This Health Condition      Other disorders     A variation in the GPR101 gene is found in a small percentage of people with sporadic acromegaly, a condition that begins in adulthood and is characterized by overgrowth of the hands and feet, \"coarse\" facial features, heart problems, and other abnormalities. Sporadic acromegaly occurs in people with no history of overgrowth in their family. This variant leads to production of an altered GPR101 protein in which the protein building block (amino acid) glutamate is replaced with the amino acid aspartic acid at position 308 (written as Glu308Asp or E308D). Studies in the lab show that this alteration can lead to a small increase in the release of growth hormone and promote the growth and division (proliferation) of cells, although researchers are unsure exactly how it is associated with acromegaly in affected individuals.While some studies found the E308D GPR101 variant in a small percentage of people with sporadic acromegaly, other studies were unable to replicate this result, suggesting that the genetic change may not play a major role in development of the condition.

            "DMD\t   DMD, the largest known human gene, provides instructions for making a protein called dystrophin. This protein is located primarily in muscles used for movement (skeletal muscles) and in heart (cardiac) muscle. Small amounts of dystrophin are present in nerve cells in the brain.In skeletal and cardiac muscles, dystrophin is part of a group of proteins (a protein complex) that work together to strengthen muscle fibers and protect them from injury as muscles contract and relax. The dystrophin complex acts as an anchor, connecting each muscle cell's structural framework (cytoskeleton) with the lattice of proteins and other molecules outside the cell (extracellular matrix). The dystrophin complex may also play a role in cell signaling by interacting with proteins that send and receive chemical signals.Little is known about the function of dystrophin in nerve cells. Research suggests that the protein is important for the normal structure and function of synapses, which are specialized connections between nerve cells where cell-to-cell communication occurs.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy     More than 2,000 mutations in the DMD gene have been identified in people with the Duchenne and Becker forms of muscular dystrophy. These conditions occur almost exclusively in males and are characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy) and a heart condition called dilated cardiomyopathy. Most of the mutations that cause these conditions delete part of the DMD gene. Other mutations abnormally duplicate part of the gene or change a small number of DNA building blocks (nucleotides) in the gene.Mutations that cause Becker muscular dystrophy, which typically has milder features and appears at a later age than Duchenne muscular dystrophy, usually lead to an abnormal version of dystrophin that retains some function. Mutations that cause the more severe Duchenne muscular dystrophy typically prevent any functional dystrophin from being produced.Skeletal and cardiac muscle cells without enough functional dystrophin become damaged as the muscles repeatedly contract and relax with use. The damaged cells weaken and die over time, causing the characteristic muscle weakness and heart problems seen in Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy. More About This Health Condition      X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy     More than 30 mutations in the DMD gene can cause an X-linked form of familial dilated cardiomyopathy. This heart condition enlarges and weakens the cardiac muscle, preventing the heart from pumping blood efficiently. Although dilated cardiomyopathy is a sign of Duchenne and Becker muscular dystrophy (described above), X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy is typically not associated with weakness and wasting of skeletal muscles.The mutations that cause X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy preferentially affect the activity of dystrophin in cardiac muscle cells. As a result of these mutations, affected individuals typically have little or no functional dystrophin in the heart. Without enough of this protein, cardiac muscle cells become damaged as the heart muscle repeatedly contracts and relaxes. The damaged muscle cells weaken and die over time, leading to the heart problems characteristic of X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy.The mutations that cause X-linked dilated cardiomyopathy often lead to reduced amounts of dystrophin in skeletal muscle cells. However, enough of this protein is present to prevent weakness and wasting of the skeletal muscles.

            "AR\t   The AR gene provides instructions for making a protein called an androgen receptor.  Androgens are hormones (such as testosterone) that are important for normal male sexual development before birth and during puberty.  Androgen receptors allow the body to respond appropriately to these hormones.  The receptors are present in many of the body's tissues, where they attach (bind) to androgens.  The resulting androgen-receptor complex then binds to DNA and regulates the activity of androgen-responsive genes. By turning the genes on or off as necessary, the androgen receptor helps direct the development of male sexual characteristics.  Androgens and androgen receptors also have other important functions in both males and females, such as regulating hair growth and sex drive.In one region of the AR gene, a DNA segment known as CAG is repeated multiple times. This CAG segment is called a triplet or trinucleotide repeat. In most people, the number of CAG repeats in the AR gene ranges from fewer than 10 to about 36.     Related Information   What is DNA?What is a gene?How do genes direct the production of proteins?More about How Genes Work           Androgen insensitivity syndrome     More than 600 different mutations in the AR gene have been identified in people with androgen insensitivity syndrome, a condition that affects sexual development before birth and during puberty. Most of these mutations are changes in single DNA building blocks (base pairs). Other mutations insert or delete multiple base pairs in the gene or affect how the gene is processed into a protein. Some mutations lead to an abnormally short version of the androgen receptor protein, while others result in the production of an abnormal receptor that cannot bind to androgens or to DNA.  As a result, cells that are sensitive to androgens become less responsive to these hormones or unable to use these hormones at all. People with this condition are genetically male, with one X chromosome and one Y chromosome in each cell. Because their bodies are unable to respond to androgens, they may have mostly female sex characteristics or signs of both male and female sexual development.Mutations that completely eliminate the function of the androgen receptor cause complete androgen insensitivity syndrome. Genetic changes that significantly reduce but do not eliminate the receptor's activity cause partial androgen insensitivity syndrome.  Mild androgen insensitivity syndrome results from changes that only slightly reduce the activity of the receptor. More About This Health Condition      Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy     Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy, a disorder of specialized nerve cells that control muscle movement (motor neurons), results from an expansion of the CAG trinucleotide repeat in the AR gene. In people with this disorder, CAG is abnormally repeated from 38 to more than 60 times. Although the extended CAG region changes the structure of the androgen receptor, it is unclear how the altered protein damages nerve cells. Researchers believe that a fragment of the androgen receptor protein containing the CAG repeats accumulates within these cells and interferes with normal cell functions. This buildup leads to the gradual loss of motor neurons, which results in muscle weakness and wasting (atrophy). More About This Health Condition      Androgenetic alopecia     Changes in the AR gene are associated with an increased risk of androgenetic alopecia, a form of hair loss also known as male-pattern baldness in men and female-pattern baldness in women. The variations result from small changes in the number or types of DNA building blocks (base pairs) that make up the AR gene. These genetic changes appear to be most frequent in men with hair loss that begins at an early age. Researchers believe that AR gene variations may increase the activity of androgen receptors in the scalp. Although androgenetic alopecia is related to the effects of androgens on hair growth, it remains unclear how changes in the AR gene increase the risk of hair loss in men and women with this condition.

            "ATP7A\t   The ATP7A gene provides instructions for making a protein that is important for regulating copper levels in the body. Copper is necessary for many cellular functions, but it is toxic when present in excessive amounts. The ATP7A protein is found throughout the body, except in liver cells. In the small intestine, this protein helps control the absorption of copper from food. In other cells, the ATP7A protein has a dual role and shuttles between two cellular locations. The protein normally resides in a cell structure called the Golgi apparatus, which modifies newly produced proteins, including enzymes. In the Golgi apparatus, the ATP7A protein supplies copper to certain enzymes that are critical for the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. If copper levels in the cell environment are elevated, however, the ATP7A protein moves to the cell membrane and eliminates excess copper from the cell.

Occipital horn syndrome is characterized by loose and sagging skin, wedge-shaped calcium deposits in a bone at the base of the skull (the occipital bone), coarse hair, and loose joints.Most of the mutations that cause occipital horn syndrome reduce but do not eliminate the production of the ATP7A protein. A shortage of this protein impairs the absorption of copper from food and prevents its normal distribution to cells throughout the body. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The reduced activity of these enzymes underlies the characteristic features of occipital horn syndrome. More About This Health Condition      Menkes syndrome     Researchers have identified more than 150 mutations in the ATP7A gene that cause Menkes syndrome. Many of these mutations delete part of the gene and likely result in a shortened ATP7A protein. Other mutations insert additional DNA building blocks (nucleotides) into the gene or change single nucleotides. All of these mutations prevent the production of functional ATP7A protein. As a result, the absorption of copper from food is impaired, and copper is not supplied to certain enzymes. The abnormal protein may get stuck in the cell membrane and become unable to shuttle back and forth from the Golgi apparatus.The disrupted activity of the ATP7A protein causes copper to be poorly distributed to cells in the body. Copper accumulates in some tissues, such as the small intestine and kidneys, while the brain and other tissues have unusually low levels. The decreased supply of copper can reduce the activity of numerous copper-containing enzymes, affecting the structure and function of bone, skin, hair, blood vessels, and the nervous system. The signs and symptoms of Menkes syndrome are caused by the reduced activity of these copper-containing enzymes.
