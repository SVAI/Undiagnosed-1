SLC35E2B	1	A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function

TLR8	2	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of the chemical reactions and pathways resulting in the formation of interferon-gamma.
CRLF2	4	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a cytokine, any of a group of proteins that function to control the survival, growth and differentiation of tissues and cells, and which have autocrine and paracrine activity.
CT45A3	3	Any process involved in forming the mature 3' end of an snRNA molecule.
CT45A10	4	Any process involved in forming the mature 3' end of an snRNA molecule.
RBMX	6	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with an RNA molecule or a portion thereof.
GPR101	1	Combining with epinephrine or norepinephrine and transmitting the signal across the membrane by activating the alpha-subunit of an associated heterotrimeric G-protein complex.
CSF2RA	8	Combining with a cytokine and transmitting the signal from one side of the membrane to the other to initiate a change in cell activity.
GPR50	1	Combining with an extracellular signal and transmitting the signal across the membrane by activating an associated G-protein; promotes the exchange of GDP for GTP on the alpha subunit of a heterotrimeric G-protein complex.
ASMTL	6	Catalysis of the reaction
ARSD	27	Catalysis of the reaction
PPP2R3B	1	A protein complex that has protein serine/threonine phosphatase activity that is polycation-stimulated (PCS), being directly stimulated by protamine, polylysine, or histone H1; it constitutes a subclass of several enzymes activated by different histones and polylysine, and consists of catalytic, scaffolding, and regulatory subunits. The catalytic and scaffolding subunits form the core enzyme, and the holoenzyme also includes the regulatory subunit.
DMD	5	The portion of the plasma membrane at the lateral side of the cell. In epithelial cells, lateral plasma membranes are on the sides of cells which lie at the interface of adjacent cells.
SSX5	2	A membrane-bounded organelle of eukaryotic cells in which chromosomes are housed and replicated. In most cells, the nucleus contains all of the cell's chromosomes except the organellar chromosomes, and is the site of RNA synthesis and processing. In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent.
DGKK	2	The chemical reactions and pathways involving glycerolipids, any lipid with a glycerol backbone. Diacylglycerol and phosphatidate are key lipid intermediates of glycerolipid biosynthesis.
SHROOM4	2	The portion of the actin cytoskeleton, comprising filamentous actin and associated proteins, that lies just beneath the plasma membrane.
NUDT11	1	Catalysis of the reaction
ZXDA	1	Interacting selectively and non-covalently with a C2H2-type zinc finger domain of a protein. The C2H2 zinc finger is the classical zinc finger domain, in which two conserved cysteines and histidines co-ordinate a zinc ion.
VCX3A	1	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the brain over time, from its formation to the mature structure. Brain development begins with patterning events in the neural tube and ends with the mature structure that is the center of thought and emotion. The brain is responsible for the coordination and control of bodily activities and the interpretation of information from the senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.).
EDA2R	4	Receiving a signal and transmitting it in the cell to initiate a change in cell activity. A signal is a physical entity or change in state that is used to transfer information in order to trigger a response.
AR	6	Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the frequency, rate or extent of extrinsic apoptotic signaling pathway.
FAM155B	1	The membrane surrounding a cell that separates the cell from its external environment. It consists of a phospholipid bilayer and associated proteins." [ISBN
NAP1L2	1	Any process that activates or increases the frequency, rate or extent of histone H3-K9 acetylation.
ATP7A	3	The network of interconnected tubular and cisternal structures located within the Golgi apparatus on the side distal to the endoplasmic reticulum, from which secretory vesicles emerge. The trans-Golgi network is important in the later stages of protein secretion where it is thought to play a key role in the sorting and targeting of secreted proteins to the correct destination.
VCX	1	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the brain over time, from its formation to the mature structure. Brain development begins with patterning events in the neural tube and ends with the mature structure that is the center of thought and emotion. The brain is responsible for the coordination and control of bodily activities and the interpretation of information from the senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.).
VCX2	3	The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the brain over time, from its formation to the mature structure. Brain development begins with patterning events in the neural tube and ends with the mature structure that is the center of thought and emotion. The brain is responsible for the coordination and control of bodily activities and the interpretation of information from the senses (sight, hearing, smell, etc.).
