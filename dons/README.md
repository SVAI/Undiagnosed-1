## Dons' Project: Beyond Undiagnosed
## Goals
* Help John identify causes.
* Identify possible causes to benefit more people who may be in similar situations.
* Set up workflow replicable.

## Hypotheses
* Recurrent themes that we observed in his symptoms point to:
* 1) brain stem area related dysfunction (nausea, difficulty regulating temperature, delayed gastric emptying, vomiting, sweating etc),
* 2) probable collagen disorder, 
* 3) probable lysosomal storage disease

## Workflow
* As a preparation, fathom medical records,  gather physicians and biologists’ thoughts, run testing by using IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) and CRAVAT VEST-4 (Variant Effect Scoring Tool),CHASM-3.1. 
* Listen to John to collect first-hand patient experience, symptoms, and reaction to medications to formulate thoughts. 
* 2-way in parallel:
* Further extract and filter medical records to gather key symptoms and diagnosis.
* Use Ingenuity Variant Analysis to find suspicious causes based on patient’s symptoms sharing.

## Our findings & suggestion for next steps
